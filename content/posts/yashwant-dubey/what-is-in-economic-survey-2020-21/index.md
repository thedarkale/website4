- The survey expects India’s real GDP to record an 11.0% growth in FY2021-22 and nominal GDP to grow by 15.4% – the highest since independence: This means that the Indian GDP in 2021-22 is expected to be at ₹149.2 lakh crore.
- The survey points out that the economy is recovering during the second half of this year. The recovery in the second half of FY2020-21 is expected to be powered by government consumption, estimated to grow at 17% YoY.

- The economic survey also supports the newly introduced farm laws, it has said that farm laws will be beneficial for small and marginal farmers and herald a new era of market freedom which can go a long way in the improvement of farmer welfare in India.
