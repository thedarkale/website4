Today I want to talk about budgeting. whenever I do my budgeting, I am very anxious, because it tells me how wasteful I am in spending my money. It also tells me what is necessary for spending and my careless spending. I think everyone hates budgeting me also, but it is a very important activity because it ensures that you will always have enough money for the things you need. To manage your monthly expenses, prepare for life’s unpredictable events, and be able to afford big-ticket items without going into debt, budgeting is important. You also want to protect it from companies as they are trying to increase your spending whether you like or not, most of the time they are successful in it. They are trying to attach you with one or more EMI that you have to pay every month making bound to a chain that makes you very uncomfortable, that’s why sticking to your budget is very important. First, let me tell you the standard definition of budgeting. Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend your money. Creating this spending plan allows you to determine in advance whether you will have enough money to do the things you need to do or would like to do. If you don’t have enough money to do everything you would like to do, then you can use this planning process to prioritize your spending and focus your money on the things that are most important to you.

Here I am introducing to a budgeting process, if you think it very complex and doesn’t suit your preferences You can design your budget plan.

1. The first step in creating a budget is to identify the amount of money you have coming in. 
2. The second step is, to begin with making a list of all you spending of the previous and current month to see where are you spending your money, you can refer to your bank statement for this. 
3. Then identify what are your fixed expenses such as rent, commuting fares etc. Next list all your variable expenses—those that may change from month to month such as food, entertainment etc. 
4. Use the variable and fixed expenses you compiled to help you get a sense of what you’ll spend in the coming months. With your fixed expenses, you can predict fairly accurately how much you’ll have to budget for. Use your past spending habits as a guide when trying to predict your variable expenses.
5. Once you’ve done all this, you have what you need to complete your budget. Having documented your income and spending, you can start to see where you have money leftover or where you can cut back so that you have money to put toward your goals.

After creating your budget plan, try to use it for a month or two and decide whether it is helping or not. If it is not helpful try to create another one. You must review your budget regularly to be sure you are staying on track.

By doing Budgeting you can also forecast which month will you have less or more money. This helps you in making realistic assumptions about your annual income and expense and plan for long terms financial goals like starting your own business or can be used as an investment in a mutual fund or equity.
