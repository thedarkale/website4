I was sceptical about this topic since tesla got famous and EVs were labelled as “Clean” or advertised as a step that will lead us to a cleaner Earth. My argument was that we are not producing electricity any cheaper than using combustion engines as we use fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and other renewable resources which also contribute to the degradation of the environment. Another argument is how we compare pollution coming manufacturing of batteries that make EVs functional, the composition of these batteries is made of rare earth metal such as lead, nickel, tungsten, and extracting & manipulation of these metal also contribute to carbon emissions.

To better understanding this topic, we have to understand what is our biggest environmental problem right now, climate change. And the cause of climate change is the rising of carbon-di-oxide in the air which produces the greenhouse effect. And the greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface.

Now, let’s compare the CO2 emission produced by internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) and Electric vehicles (EV). A comparative study between EVs and ICEV in China confirms the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICTT) report that the CO2 emission from the production of an EV is about 14.6 t, 59%, and 60% higher than the level of an ICEV 9.2 t in china. which is bad but Study also states that the emissions can be cut by up to 66% if they adopted American or European manufacturing techniques.

According to another study of emission between EV and ICEV in Japan 2019 - As the vehicle was driven longer, the lifecycle CO2 emission of EV became lower than that of ICEV, except in Australia where ICEV emission was lower than EV until the end of life. Another observation on the study was that regional sources of power generation (coal, the contribution from renewable sources, etc.) had a great effect on the CO2 emissions of EV. The more the generated electricity came from renewables, the lower the CO2 emissions of EV were than those of ICEV.

A new study by the Centre for Economic Studies (CES) in Munich proclaimed: “Germany’s current energy mix and the amount of energy used in battery production, the CO2 emissions of battery-electric vehicles are, in the best case, slightly higher than those of a diesel engine, and are otherwise much higher.”

After reading these papers what I have concluded one of the important factors is how electricity is produced. In the case of Australia, fossil fuels contributed 79% of total electricity generation and the emission from this will always will more than the emission from ICEV in one lifecycle.

In my opinion, currently, electric vehicles as they stand on technology and how they produce batteries are far less polluting than their combustion engine counterparts. But in some cases, like Australia, the same cannot be said. As the technology becomes more advanced, Electric vehicles will become more efficient and reliable. As we are moving in the future Car manufacturers are also accepting the fact that electric cars are less polluting and are producing more EVs than ever. According to statistics EVs are predicted to represent 31% of all cars on the road in 2040, making up 67% of municipal buses, 47% of two-wheeled vehicles (and 24% of light commercial vehicles. Compare this to 2020, where EVs make up 33% of municipal buses, 30% of two-wheeled vehicles, and 2% of light commercial vehicles. We are moving towards a different future.
