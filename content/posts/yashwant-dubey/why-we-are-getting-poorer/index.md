Do you know we are getting poorer by every next minute? Why as a child you could have bought *₹20* chocolate in *₹5* Why petrol is getting way expensive? why you have to pay more for your meal now than a decade ago? **Inflation** is the answer to the above questions.

The basic definition of **Inflation** is *“a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time, when the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services”*. In simpler terms inflation is the upward movement in the overall price level of goods and services in the economy. It has the effect of devaluing a particular currency.

Let take an example to understand this, Let's say you earn *₹110* and spends ₹100, then you are saving *₹10* and let's assume inflation rate is *3%* then next time you will spend *₹103* in your same ₹110 earning and your saving reduces to ₹7. That’s how inflation works.

There are two major cause of inflation: <u>Demand-Pull</u> effect and <u>Cost-Push</u> effect. In <u>Demand-Pull</u> effect supply of money increases which stimulates people to buy more than the production capacity. This <u>Demand-Supply</u> gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. In <u>Cost-Push</u> inflation increase in prices of inputs like <u>Labour</u>, <u>Raw Material</u>, etc. The increased price of the factors of production leads to a decreased supply of these goods. While the demand remains constant, the prices of commodities increase causing a rise in the overall price level.

Now let’s discuss why it not good to leave your money in saving account of your bank. Let’s say you have *₹100* in a savings account that pays a *1%* interest rate. After a year, you will have *₹101* in your account. But if the rate of inflation is running at *2%*, you would need *₹102* to have the same buying power that you started with. That’s how you lose your saving in Saving accounts. In India currently inflation rate is *3.75%* and **SBI** gives an interest of *2.70%* p.a. on its saving account. So, if you only keep money in your saving account do not invest in <u>Fixed Depots</u> (Current FD avg interest rates are 4.90%), <u>Mutual Funds</u>, <u>Equity</u>, Etc. Which have more interest rate than your saving account your money will be devaluing by rate of *1.05%*. Thats why it is now very important to invest your money in varies mediums.
