Do you know we are getting poorer by every next minute? Why as a child you could have bought _₹20_ chocolate in _₹5_ Why petrol is getting way expensive? why you have to pay more for your meal now than a decade ago? **Inflation** is the answer to the above questions.

The basic definition of **Inflation** is _“a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time, when the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services”_. In simpler terms inflation is the upward movement in the overall price level of goods and services in the economy. It has the effect of devaluing a particular currency.

Let take an example to understand this, Let's say you earn _₹110_ and spends ₹100, then you are saving _₹10_ and let's assume inflation rate is _3%_ then next time you will spend _₹103_ in your same ₹110 earning and your saving reduces to ₹7. That’s how inflation works.

There are two major cause of inflation: <u>Demand-Pull</u> effect and <u>Cost-Push</u> effect. In <u>Demand-Pull</u> effect supply of money increases which stimulates people to buy more than the production capacity. This <u>Demand-Supply</u> gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. In <u>Cost-Push</u> inflation increase in prices of inputs like <u>Labour</u>, <u>Raw Material</u>, etc. The increased price of the factors of production leads to a decreased supply of these goods. While the demand remains constant, the prices of commodities increase causing a rise in the overall price level.

Now let’s discuss why it not good to leave your money in saving account of your bank. Let’s say you have _₹100_ in a savings account that pays a _1%_ interest rate. After a year, you will have _₹101_ in your account. But if the rate of inflation is running at _2%_, you would need _₹102_ to have the same buying power that you started with. That’s how you lose your saving in Saving accounts. In India currently inflation rate is _3.75%_ and **SBI** gives an interest of _2.70%_ p.a. on its saving account. So, if you only keep money in your saving account do not invest in <u>Fixed Depots</u> (Current FD avg interest rates are 4.90%), <u>Mutual Funds</u>, <u>Equity</u>, Etc. Which have more interest rate than your saving account your money will be devaluing by rate of _1.05%_. Thats why it is now very important to invest your money in varies mediums.
