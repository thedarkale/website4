Bros have always been debating for which is the better way to train your body, is it bodyweight exercise or is it weighted exercise. I have that too from time to time with my friends. Although in technical sense there are four types of basic training methods:

1. Free Weights Exercise
2. Weight Machines
3. Body Weight Training
4. Cardio Workout

But for the sake of comparison I've merged 1. and 2. point into Weights because they both need some kind of weighted equipment to maneuver. Also point 3. and 4. have been merged to Bodyweight since it requires nothing but your body to build strength and endurance.

I'm not here to tell you what to do or what are the methods of doing these exercises. I'm here to establish a school of thought. Where? Inside you, yes! So you can take rational decisions while considering all the below mentioned points and make yourself your own exercise program.

## Body Weight Training 

Does strength really mean big and bulky? I don't think so. You can have strength and not have any bulky muscles like weight lifters. Some exercises are: pull ups, push ups, squats, etc.

### Pros

1. By using additional muscles you stabilize your posture and mobility in your movements.
2. These bodyweight exercises are all inspired from everyday human movement, so by doing these exercises you're increasing your agility in everyday tasks.
3. No equipment required.
4. Less chance of injuries comparatively.
5. free of cost. It's like free money but money is healthy here.
6. Improve overall athleticism.

### Cons

1. Seems hard for beginners and may yield results in the long run.
2. Mostly not done indoors.

## Weights Training 

Example: Deadlift, Squats, etc.

### Pros

1. You can have a completely natural body movement apart from bodyweight like the muscle up which is not natural at all.
2. Since you're full control you can increase weight by progression and see it work.
3. Ideal for indoor4. Easier movements, easy to learn and do.

### Cons

1. You have to buy weights
2. Risk of injuries
3. Bulk your body with muscles ( it's good if you want it but bad if you don't. Like people from the skinny is healthy movement don't like this, just like me )
4. It's not natural. It can stress on joints.

## MythBusters

There are many myths in this field and here are some of them.

1. Weights are for adding bulk muscle.
2. Gym machines give better results than free weights in toning your body.
3. Bodyweight exercise won't give you gains.

## Conclusion

Since some exercise are more ideal for you than others based on factors like:

1. Training Purpose: Your own fitness goal. Are you doing to lose weight, etc.
2. Training Reason: If you're learning martial arts you should choose body weight. If you're a trainer it depends on what you're teaching.
3. Best Match: It also depends on the body type and genetics like some people have fast flexor muscles some have slow. Fast flexor will give you advantage in bodyweight exercise and competations and vice-versa.
4. Convenience: Are you doing this part time or you're giving this whole of your day.
5. Hobby: If you're a climber or boulderer or like calisthenics you should probably go to bodyweight. If you want to do weight lifting you'd choose weights.
6. Progression: You like to see quick progressions you should do weights.
7. Performance: If you want to increase your strength in a short time you can go with weights.
8. Looks: If you want to look good, toned muscular body you can go with weights.
9. Posture: If you're recovering from some injury or you want a good posture then you should go with body weights.

> So... what's the final verdict? The answer is there isn't any, despite from the experience level you should do both or weighted body exercise.
