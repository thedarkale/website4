# Abstract

How important is education research? Well, it’s important to know its importance in the field of education. The scientist took decades to search on a particular piece of black stone leading to the discovery of coal which took millions of years for its formation under the layers of soil. Coal is a legitimate proof of research. What Scientist do they go on searching and researching in a field and therefore they came up with a conclusion which ultimately becomes a theory. These theories help in building a base for teaching methodology and scientific analysis. Scientific research has an impact on education. The author has explained the importance and types of research. Further what is the steps to be followed in research are also mentioned in this article. It has also touched the challenges faced by teachers and research scholars during research.

# Introduction

What is Research?
Research refers to the finding of new facts and digging deep into a topic to extract the best knowledge out of it. It helps in understanding a topic better in a way which leads to raising more questions. It helps to take one step further in our professional carrier and digging deeper into the subject helps us understand in-depth knowledge. One such research is Research Methodology which helps University professors and Scholars to enhance professional growth and knowledge. It’s a good opportunity for such people to publish their work in a recognized publishing house and can seek new growth opportunities in their respective fields.

# Research

## 1. Types

Qualitative Research: It includes opinion, suggestion, comment by researchers in the form of article, blog, thesis, Research journals etc. It aims to provide meaning, feeling, and analysis of a particular topic. It cannot be represented on a graph. It navigates how and why of decision making.

Quantitative Research: It includes numbers and statistics in the form of graphs, charts, diagrams, and figures showing a systematic analysis of data. It helps in understanding the information easily with minimum confusion. This type of data is used when you want to show the numerical figures or if you are talking about a survey or experimental research. Quantitative data is used to simplify a large sum of data collected on a big scale and helps in proper analysing it. With more amounts of data, you can obtain accurate results.

One such research type is a combination of these two Quantitative and Qualitative data known as mixed data.

## 2. Applied Research

It focuses on analyzing and solving real-life problems using the scientific method. This type refers to a study that helps solve practical problems using scientific methods. Studies play an important role in solving issues that impact the overall well-being of humans. For example: _finding special cure for a disease_[^1].

# Steps of Research

To achieve the desired result procedure of research has to be followed. You just can’t browse the internet without having a clue of what you need to do first. Research done without a plan or procedure is a waste of time and also the desired result would not be achieved. Ask yourself two questions before engaging yourself in research.

Why you are doing it? How are you going to do it? You need a plan for what you are searching for and how to extract the relevant information useful for you. Following are the steps in the research process:

1. **Identify a problem**
   The first and most important thing is to identify a problem. Once the problem is identified we can think about the root cause of that problem.
2. **Define the problem**
   It answers ‘How are you going to do it’? The problem being addressed must be properly analysed before going deep into the ocean.
3. **Objectives**
   It helps to define what your result is. What do you want to achieve? It shows what you want to achieve and helps to convey to your learner about your piece of work?
4. **Hypothesis**
   A hypothesis is a tentative statement about the relationship between two or more variables. It is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to happen in a study[2]. It is the crux of the whole research procedure to be followed.
5. **Data Collection**
   Data collection sources are of two types Primary source and Secondary source. Primary sources are those sources whose data has been taken first handed and is the authentic source for collection of data. Secondary source on the other hand is the second-hand source of collecting data. It can be either review of people, their comment on a particular field, their opinions, blogs, articles, Research papers.
6. **Data Analysis**
   This is the second step of the Data collection process in which collected data is analysed.
   In Quantitative data, a study of graphical representation, graphs, pie carts and bar graphs are studied using mathematical calculations and data are analysed. Scientific methods and mathematical formulae like mean, mode, median; ANOVA, ANCOVA, t-test etc. help in calculating the data and analyzing it.
   In Qualitative data, a study of content analysis by going through various sources and then after analyzing it can be drafted comprehensively for people to study it.
7. **Data Interpretation**
   After analysing and studying the data carefully you need to extract the relevant information for which the data has been collected in the form of blogs, articles, research papers & thesis.
8. **Result & Generalisation**
   After performing all the above procedures a result is drawn and categorised in a format easy for the people to interpret and analyse the information shared.

# Benefits of Research in Education

As it is said Research is a weapon for teachers and students. It gives ample benefits to striking out doubts and gives a chance to teachers & students to discover new ways of teaching and help students learn better, understand and are easy for them to grasp.

Following are the benefits of research in education:

1. Help you find solutions to particular problems arising in school or college.
2. Underpin professional learning of knowledge, skills and understanding.
3. Connect to you with sources of information and network of professional support.
4. Clarify purpose, priority and process when introducing change like for ex- assessment, prodigy and curriculum.
5. Improve understanding of your professional and policy context, originally, locally and nationally enabling you to teach and lead more strategically and logically.
6. _Develop your agency, influence, self- efficacy within your own school or college and more widely within the profession_[^3].

# Challenges in Research in Education

## 1. Research by Students

Gone were the days when students spent hours and hour’s sitting in the library flipping pages to pages searching for the right content. Those were the days when Plagiarism was not so recognised and Copyright laws were not known to people. Technology being a boon to the society has cleared our path-holes and pitfalls in the path to a high level of research. Enhancement in technology has created a unique stream for Education like Online Platforms, has allowed students to do courses at a reasonable rate Online Exams like CAT, CLAT and more entrance are all online.

Students are the future assets of our nation. Indian Education system which is more inclined to mugging things up and puking it on to their answer sheets. After the introduction of Value-based questions in school’s, it tests the reasoning ability of students regarding their appropriate Subjects. It’s not just confined to answering the same definition which the teacher told them to write but it gives them a wider circumference to explain their understanding in a much better and concise way. It does not only test their understanding but develops a sense of learning the practical aspect as well. Today Youths are more aware of what courses to choose which job suits them and are not just confined to regular course books but in search of new opportunities which gives them a platform to perform in skilful jobs. In most Universities which make students go through industrial visits, mandatory internship’s and the submission of their project based on what they learn during the internships help them in researching and help them flip another side of the coin. The concept of internship helps students to acknowledge the practical aspect of the subject which is useful for their overall development. Some publications publish their annual Journals which gives students a platform to show their analytical skills.

Specialised courses like PhD in Humanities, Science, Law, and Medical, Arts etc. helping young graduates to approach and making it easy to look out for jobs in Educational Institutions.

## 2. Research by Teachers & Scholars

Teaching is not just confined to Blackboard and a snippet Chalk. The Research Phenomenon of teaching in the field of education which not only helps young Teachers and College Professors in their respective fields but also gives a new incite to teaching methods. The impact of Research on teaching will leave a long term impression on the students and a teacher should always be open to new ideas. Research is a weapon which can be used by teachers to inculcate students on the bright side of its teaching. If research is open to new fields and existing fields it gives ways for new ideas to reach to the public.

In today’s generation students are very active when it comes down to how much subject knowledge a teacher has whether it is the current topic which you are teaching or any topic relating to it. Students can ask any questions or queries on or off the topic so to be well versed with the topic Research is that key which unlocks all such barriers. A proper methodology and correct sense of knowledge will fill such loopholes.

Research is not just confined to teaching it involves a whole division of other aspects such as how to deal with weak students to cope up with you, the psychology of students, personality traits and how to manage it side by side. They know every aspect of your teaching.

# Conclusion

From the following article, we can conclude by saying research is a catalyst in the chemical reaction of education which helps in a rapid flow of education to run smoothly and make it easy for it to flow. Research in education helps not only bring advancements in education but it also gives a clear and thorough analysis of any particular subject. It helps to solve problems scientifically and methodically. It is a systematic effort to acquire new knowledge in all streams.
