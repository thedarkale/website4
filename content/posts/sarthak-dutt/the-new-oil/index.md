There was a time when Oil was the most expensive and profitable commodity in the international market. Gulf countries have made millions out of it and had a monopoly over it. 
You might be thinking of why the word “Data” is there as a topic and why are we associating it with Oil and Petroleum industries??
Data in the current scenario has become the most valuable asset of all times. The big five companies have made millions out of that data. We are moving towards Industrial Revolution 4 and in the era of high-speed internet and upcoming telecom services like 5G. We are ignorant of the fact that how these social media platforms that we cannot live without are the most valuable Companies of all time and they are earning Millions of Dollars every year through our data. Their earning is so high that they are among the wealthiest companies of all time in human history. If you are well acquainted with the facts of the famous case which influenced the 2016 US elections then you are well aware of what I’m talking about. There were allegations on Facebook that it transferred its data to a Russian Company which influenced the citizens of the US to attract voting percentage in favour of Donald Trump. The wave of getting peoples data has become a new trend among the Big Five Companies like Alphabet, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook.  

After the Covid-19 outbreak, most of the work has gone online the new normal has made people work from home. I have seen people in the last year being very health-conscious and their health concerns have increased. Corporate bodies on the other hand are concerned about their firm’s data getting leaked through private Wi-fi networks. Cyber threats often target companies with huge data leaks like earlier this week online wallet Mobikwik data was which was the biggest data privacy breach of all time. Cyber-attacks like phishing, a man in the middle attack, DNS tunnelling, SQL injection etc. in the past few years have increased. 

So recently Facebook ink. WhatsApp posted a Privacy policy that every user has to accept before the 8th of February or else you have to leave. It put all its user in a situation of doing or die which made users switching to other apps. As WhatsApp claims that all the messages are encrypted even WhatsApp will not be able to detect the chats between two people. Yet it seems its new privacy policy has some different outlook on privacy norms. The issue that attracted major media attention was that the current NDA government was planning concerning the data localization issue according to which all major servers will have an on-premises model within India. How this will impact the privacy of Indian users to such websites will depend on in the forthcoming years. 

The Delhi HC in its recent appeal to the Apex court asking the central government to stop WhatsApp to proceed with its new privacy policy which is now extended to 15th May which is violative of the IT Rules of 2011. Following are the lacunas in its policies:
1.	The purpose for which the data is been collected is not explained properly and is not going to be used as per the Rules and therefore contrary to the law. 
2.	Though it claims that the collected data will not be sent to a 3rd party and yet there is no specification as to reliability that the said data will not be transferred.
3.	The privacy policy once accepted cannot be withdrawn by the user. That simply means once a user gives its consent for that data to be shared with WhatsApp it cannot be withdrawn. 
IT Rule of 2021 makes it mandatory for social media / OTT platforms to appoint a Compliance Officer within India, an annual report must be submitted related to the grievances addressed, it has a slight inclination towards the protection of women in case explicit content is being viewed or is of such a nature that it outrages the modesty of women in any sense then it has to be removed within 48hours of notice,  an officer has to be appointed who will act as an intermediary between the Government officials and the corporation. The government wants that data to be shared with the investigation officer as and when required by them One drawback of this bill is that the government wants to keep an eye on individual’s privacy which is a violation of our Fundamental Rights. As the famous quote says “every cloud has a silver lining” the bill pinpoints that the person who spreads fake news can be easily detected without his / her identity getting revealed.

Right to privacy was not considered to be a Fundamental Right after many cases emerged and finally after scrapping down of the colonial era rule I e. section 377 of IPC we finally proved sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in a private place comes under the ambit of right to privacy. The new Data Protection is not very effective as the GDPR prescribes yet we need stringent laws on data privacy.

The Data General Data Protection Regulation the EU’s parliament which was passed in the year 2018 and has broadened its scope across the world. The compliances in it are very stringent. Even if a company agrees to transfer data from Europe then it has to be deleted immediately after the purpose is fulfilled that refers to as the Purpose limitation Doctrine. Under the GDPR it gives exclusive rights to citizens of withdrawing their consent once they accept to give their data for processing. It means the data Fiduciary has to delete the data entirely & immediately from its database once the consent is withdrawn by Data Subject. In India, the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 is yet to be finalized in the parliament but it needs some new alterations taking references from the Emerging technologies and regarding other nations as well.
