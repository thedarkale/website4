I first came to know about imagined realities when I was reading Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari in the time of quarantine in hot summer days. After reading this book for a while I came across a paragraph which explained the idea of imagined realities. According to the book Imagine reality is something which is imagined by a person or a group of people but after a period of time people start believing that it is true. The author explained the idea by taking an example of a company, we’ll do the same so that the point becomes clear. To understand we have to ask this question “How does a company exist?”. Answers to this question may differ from person to person, some would say that people contribute to the companies, so people are companies. Others would argue that machines and assets add true value to the companies. If these ideas are true then after firing all the employees and selling all the assets of a company, the company should not exist. Legally the company still exists in papers and documents. However It has no physical form, it exists and it affects people’s life. People also believe that it is real and they work for it.

Yuval also says that the idea that a company exists in paper is developed to protest the company from lawsuits and other legal problems. Nobody can directly target the owner because the responsibility goes to imagined and unreal forms of reality.

> This leads to a conclusion that people may believe something which does not exist in real life. Something intangible and unreal. But another question which arises from this view is why people believe in something which is unreal? The answer is what makes us human, different from all the other species present in the earth. Us believing unreal and imagined things is an outcome of cognitive revolution.
