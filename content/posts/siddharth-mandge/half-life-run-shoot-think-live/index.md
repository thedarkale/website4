One of the most popular genre in the gaming industry is FPS (First Person Shooter) games. There are too many titles in this genre to even count but only some stand out with their unique presentation, gameplay, narrative and story telling. Games like Doom, Unreal Tournament and Wolfenstein are some that made this genre very famous with fast paced action and non stop shooting, people absolutely loved that. These games paved for the future generation games that drew inspiration from them. Until 1998 all games were trying to copy the success formula laid out by the games talked about previously.

But in 1998 a company called **‘Valve’** (a company founded by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington, former Microsoft Employees) came out with a new game **‘Half-Life’**. This game was made on a heavily modified version of the Quake engine and was called **‘GoldSrc’**. Basically the game is about the protagonist **‘Gordon Freeman’** who is a MIT graduate and a Theoretical Physicist who gets stuck in the facility of **‘Black Mesa’** and must fight aliens and human soldiers to save his own life. This game essentially not only won multiple **‘Game of the Year Awards’** but created a divide in the gaming history creating two eras : The Pre-Half-Life games and Post-Half-Life games. It was critically acclaimed and very well received and appreciated for its story narrative and fast paced action and non stop shooting as well as physics based puzzle solving too.

The storytelling of Half-Life is a unique approach as it does not contain any cut scenes but instead chooses to tell us the story through scripted dialogues and through the environment that Gordon witnesses with his own eyes, which in turn means through the person playing the game. The game feels much more immersive because there are no pauses and the player is fully in control of Gordon at all times. The game begins with a monorail ride with us witnessing things happening around and we of course are running late. As soon as we enter the facility we can start looking around and try to understand what is going on. The iconic moment where we get the **‘H.E.V Suit’** also rolls in and the surreal feel and sheer excitement of what is going to happen next takes over us. The story continues as we go into the test chamber and the experiment goes wrong causing a **‘Resonance Cascade’** which opens up portals from new dimensions and the aliens of **‘Xen’** get teleported to Black Mesa causing chaos and starting our survival run.

Throughout the game we have to constantly find ways to survive while using the weapons wisely. The ammo conservation is also an important deal as we have limited ammo and it cannot be wasted on shooting some headcrabs which can be dealt with by using just the iconic crowbar (the first weapon we get). But at a lot of stages we need to be wiser and try to just sneak our way out if possible and that’s the reason this game is not your usual FPS game with mindless shooting and running and dodging. It is about using your head and your resources. You have to be frugal about the weapons and try to resort to other ways possible. There are many levels that also demand to solve a certain physics based puzzle that demands quick thinking as well.

This game offered people a complete new experience that had never been explored before and this also was the reason people loved it so much. The graphics, the environment and the immersive soundtrack only contributed to this success. In my opinion everyone should try this game out and experience it for themselves. This game inspired a lot of new games and cemented it’s position as one of the best FPS games ever. Not only the original Half-Life but the sequels were ground-breaking success.
