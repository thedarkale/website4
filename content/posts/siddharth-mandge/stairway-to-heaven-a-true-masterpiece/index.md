If you ask someone who listens to rock music about Stairway to Heaven, you should not be surprised if they tell you that it is one of the greatest rock songs ever made. Led Zeppelin made their 4th and final album simply referred to as ‘Led Zeppelin IV’. This untitled album was produced by Robert Plant and Jimmy Page along with fellow band members who contributed to the production of this album. This album was produced between December 1970 and February 1971. Stairway to Heaven was the 4th track on the album and now serves as one of the best-produced rock songs of all time. 

So what makes this song so amazing and unique?

To understand that we need to break down the song into the instrumental composition and the lyrics. 

Stairway to heaven progresses in 3 major parts. Each part progresses with increasing tempo and volume. The first part of the song is slow-paced and involves just the acoustic instruments and a recorder. This part is often compared to olden time music of the Renaissance era. The slow-paced beginning of the song and the simplicity is what makes you curious as to what is to come next. 

The next part comes where the electronic instruments are added and joined in thus making the song feel getting more alive and alive and we start to feel getting drawn in further and further. The song starts to get faster and louder.

The third and final part begins with the introduction of the drums and the song begins to pick up the tempo and get more immersive. As the song progresses we are met with the guitar solo that was arranged and played by Jimmy Page himself. The solo performed by Jimmy is considered to be the greatest of all time. Jimmy recorded 3 improvised solos for the song and selected one out of them that fit the best.

Throughout the song, we are met with the vocals of Robert Plant in all three sections. In the end, Robert sings at the high pitch voice and the song comes to an end with vocals fading away.

The greatest thing about the 3 parts of the song is as if it is like a story. And not just any story but the type that has been told all along the time. The story is set in a land of the old-time and the story consists of a  hero who sets out on an adventure to discover something. It is the most commonly told story type. All the fantasy stories have this basic framework. If we look at the first part of the song which is slow-paced we start to imagine us being a part of a small old village and as the song progresses to the second part we jump to the urgency and the need to set out on an adventure. When the third part begins we start to discover the new parts of life. Just like the slow-paced song, the life was slow-paced too but as the adventure begins to deepen and the tempo begins to increase along the volume we start to discover the new perspective just like you would if you were to set out on an adventure and run into the new things. The Climax of the story arrives when the solo kicks in and we can imagine a battle of the hero against the villain/beast/monster that he/she must fight and triumph over to bring the adventure to an end. As the song fades out we have a sense of accomplishment in us and that's where I imagine the concept of the storytelling came in and what makes this song so amazing.

Now if we talk about the lyrics. The meaning of the song can be interpreted in various ways. It is the fact that Robert Plant wrote the lyrics of this song within an hour makes it even more obscure. He declared that the song is open to interpretations. It is the signature of a true artist that he/she wants people to figure out the various meanings of a particular thing, be it a song, movie, art or anything. The artist wants people to interpret it in their way. But if we talk about the literal meaning of the lyrics it describes a lady and her materialistic thinking and being misguided about reality and thinks she will be able to buy her way into heaven. The lady is wrong in her ways of thinking and when her time will finally come she will realise that she was wrong. Robert talks about the aspects of spirituality and how everything will be left behind in the end but the deeds that we did will be left behind. The line _“If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow. Don’t be alarmed now. It’s just a spring-clean for the May Queen”_ It basically describes our confused minds that want to find the right path and we often are troubled with such thoughts. By the end of the song, it is made clear that coming along as a community and being unified in harmony is what we should focus on. Materialistic perversions and all the negative aspects of being a human will prevail but we need to learn to look above that. _When all are one and one is all / To be a rock and not to roll._ This signifies what Led Zeppelin wants from us. 

But talking about the song various controversies tried to cloud and taint the image of this song.

The band were sued for copyright in 2014 over claims they had stolen the song's opening riff from Taurus, by a US band called Spirit. Led Zeppelin won the case in 2016, but it was revived on appeal in 2018. But the final decision was in favour of Led Zeppelin and the case was closed.

The second case of controversy was raised when the song was alleged of having anti-Christian and satanic messages backmasked in the song. Backmasking is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional. The subliminal messages hidden about satan are utterly stupid and does not make any sense. Although considering the sentiments of the Christian community the appropriate laws were passed. But Robert Plant himself stated that the song was made in the best intentions possible and it would be utterly stupid to sit and add such subliminal messages in any song. 

To conclude although a lot of controversies came in the way of this beautiful masterpiece which is considered to be the best rock song ever produced yet this song still exists and will continue to exist and I believe will be discovered by the generations to come and be celebrated and appreciated. Because in the end what matters is _“To be a rock and not to roll”._
