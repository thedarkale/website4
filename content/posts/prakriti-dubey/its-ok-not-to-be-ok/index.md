A warm hug, a tap on the shoulder or even a smile will do. These gestures will not cost you anything. But they might save a soul. You might mock me saying ‘How can a smile save a soul, it's ridiculous. Well, read the blog and see for yourself. Your answer might change at the end. 

Before saying anything else let me ask you a few questions. Be true to yourself.
How many times did you smile at a stranger today? 
Have you tried talking to the elderly when you see them sitting on a park bench?
How many times have you appreciated yourself today?
How many days has it been since you took a walk barefoot on the grass, or danced till you feel like your heart is going to explode, or took some time out for your self-care? 

You can never underestimate the answers to these questions. If your answers are ‘No’, ‘I do not remember or something like ‘why is it important?’ or ‘does it matter’, ‘I mean, I don't care about such stuff’ then my friend you should read this blog carefully. And for those who got all the positive answers, let me tell you this is not enough.

Mental Health is very important It affects everything. The questions that I asked above reflect your mental fitness. Mental wellbeing and fitness are even more important in today's metro life. With increasing traffic jams, pressure and competition everyone is annoyed most of the time. We are the generation with anger issues, depression and mood swings. We are the generation who find ourselves contained in a room most of the time by ourselves. Why?  Because we have reasons. If you think about it we are dejected with the government, we don't have fresh air to breathe nor fresh water to drink. We are busy making our social media profile look all happy and happening. We are not true to our soul. We are constantly wearing fake smile and busy making fake friends in the fake world. Going bonkers over social media challenges, most of them taking us even further from reality. We are frustrated even more now because of covid. It's getting harder to get a job and run a business. With GDP going down it seems like the sun is setting and we are in for a long winter night. (WINTER IS COMING!) 
Let us cut the chase, long story short Mental health is Important.

Now the question arises of how to maintain mental fitness.
1. Become a child again. When you think about it our childhood was never this stressful. We used to play for hours and spend time with friends. We used to play Galli cricket, kho-kho, football and whatnot. You were not bothered by what people will say. You were least worried about what you wear. It DIDN’T bother you if you ran barefoot, or you fell in front of your friends. But things have changed now. Yeah, right they are. You are a manager now. You have got a status to maintain. You cannot run barefoot. You care what people will think. You will be embarrassed if you fall in front of people. 
This is what is changed! You changed. You can see the irony here. 
2. Learn. As a child, you used to learn 50 new words daily. What’s your score now? Are you growing as a person? We need to grow with time. Have you heard of the generation gap? Where do you think it all starts? If we will not grow with time, or will not learn constantly then we will eventually grow apart from our young ones. The generation gap is real my friend. Realise it now or you will be in one.
3. Tell good stories. Stories are a way to solidify memories. So go ahead and make your memories rock solid. Practice telling your stories so that they are interesting, compelling and fun.
4. Turn off your TV/Netflix/Phone for a day or two. Make life real not a reel.
5. Exercise and eat for your brain!
6. Change: Make simple changes. To keep your brain young challenge your brain once a day. For instance, try eating with your left hand. Eat dessert first. We also have hobbies and pastimes. Don’t we? This will force your brain to pay attention again. 
7. Achieve mindfulness by meditation.
You can fight major illnesses with these small 7 steps. Depression is one of them.
‘Depression’ is the reason for around 800,000 deaths every year. Just think about the impact depression has, that people opt for suicide. Apart from this, around 300 million people are suffering as you read this blog.  
Depression is a mood disorder. It makes you feel sad constantly and you ultimately lack interest in life. The activities that you once loved will not be interesting anymore. You feel alone 
and blue. You will see changes in appetite and sleeping patterns. Because of this mood swings will kick in and you will have a hard time thinking, making decisions and concentrating. This is when thoughts of ‘Ending one's life’ knocks on the door.

We need to follow the 7 steps mentioned above. And here is where a smile comes into play. A smile or a kind gesture is necessary for today's life. It’s about time that we connect. It is a win-win as it will not cost you anything and will lighten up the receivers day.

REEL NOT REAL!  We live in a fake world of reels. Many around you might be having suicidal thoughts.  But as we have grown emotionally detached and apart from each other of which we are unaware. 
When you feel trapped and want to escape reality. You wish there was someone. But you see, you need to be emotionally available for others too. It’s all about to give and take. If you want a smile give a smile, If you want to be loved then go ahead and love someone first. If you want someone to help, then give someone a leg first. It's always great to give even if you don't receive anything in return. One should do favours often.

‘India is the most depressed country in the world’. I am not saying this, It is a fact. But I wanna ask WHY? Is it so difficult? Asking a friend: ‘Let's have a cup of coffee?’, ‘Let's catch up over drinks?’ or ‘What's going on with you?’. Many people nowadays think that you are invading their privacy if you ask such questions. But it's good to socialise in real. 200 Fake friends are not good enough. 2 real friends are all you need.
If you feel low at any point in time just reach out to your friends and family. Remember it’s ok not to be OK! 
Believe me on this. You will find happiness and peace. :)
