Dadri, Seraikela, Alwar, Una, Manekwada, Bhadraniya. No, these are not cities and towns from The US these are places in India where dreadful news of violence against minorities have surfaced over the past 6 years. It is not a hidden fact that Indian police uses unconstitutional physical force in everyday duties, be it checking for someone’s driver’s license or beating up someone on mere suspicion. Leave the police aside for moment first let’s talk about those places in the beginning. In 2015 Dadri, UP a mob barged into Mohammad Akhlaq’s home hacked him to death and severely injured his whole family including his old mother, what was the reason? Just a rumour that he possesses some cow meat in his fridge, entire nation of the majority sentiment came into support for the mob violence and became the judge and jury without even knowing all the facts and some mainstream right-wing politicians called for strict action against Akhlaq’s family.

2017 Alwar, Rajasthan Pehlu Khan a dairy farmer along with his two sons was returning from a cattle fair (Haat) was stopped by self-proclaimed cow vigilantes ( Gau Rakshaks) accused Pehlu Khan of illegally smuggling cows and they were brutally beaten up by the mob ‘on camera’. Two days later Pehlu Khan succumbed to his injuries. In a highly botched up police Investigation led all of the accused Scott free even after they’re faces were clearly shown in the video. Ideologically motivated investigation? you already have the answer.

2016 Una, Gujarat a group of cow vigilantes spotted Vashram Sarvaiya and his sons skinning a dead cow near Mota Samadhiyala village, the mob accused them of killing and the cow, Vashram and other members of the group tried to convince the mob that the cow was already dead but In India, nothing comes above caste supremacy. The mob-tied four members to the back of their car shirtless and publicly paraded them beating them with sticks, knives and iron pipe, this time again documenting the whole incident on camera in praise for themselves. The incident caused national outrage among Dalits and Scheduled Caste community, 43 people were accused in this case including ‘4 policemen’. For protesting against the incident the BJP led state government filed cases against the protesters mostly from the Scheduled Castes community and jailed them.

These were only some incidents of mob violence which thankfully got into the mainstream media, many stories like these don’t even surface on the news. These mob violence mainly were motivated by casteist ideology and hate against other minorities often encouraged by the currently ruling political class, a message has been conveyed to the masses that it is okay to act violently against anyone if it fits our ideology and agenda, the state is with you. Why may you ask? National Crime Records Bureau (NCBR) shows that cases of violence against Dalits have risen in the past six years, coincidence? maybe not.

Now coming to police brutality, see the recent cases of anti-CAA-NRC protest mostly led by students often from Jamila Millia Islamia, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Aligarh Muslim University, partial nature of the Delhi Police was an absolute conclusion that Police is standing with the state even if the state tells them to unconstitutionally enter a university premise, entering a library and beating up students who were studying for their exams, not just that but also destroying the library, again this move was cheered up by majority community of the nation citing an anti-nationals study in these universities and by anti-nationals they mean mainly ‘Muslims’. The deadly Delhi Riots is also a shining example of the great work done by the Delhi Police giving all the protection to the prime violence inciter BJP’s Kapil Mishra and slapping UAPA on students from Jamia connecting them to the riots.

Sadly, violence and hate against minorities from Police and the majority community has now been normalized and is backed by the State. This might help the government win another election but the divide within the country is getting wider day by day, we cannot afford this divide in these troubled times of economic instability and unemployment. What happened to George Floyd was inhumane and those police officers should be brought to severe punishment soon, but I want to ask the Indian majority community which is very vocal on social media about racism in The US, have you taken a good look at yourself and the problem of hate crimes against our minorities? I want to ask all those parents, why do you want fairness in your daughters or sons in law? I want to ask all those celebrities, why are you tweeting #blacklivesmatter and openly endorsing fairness creams.

We have to find answers to these hard-hitting questions and our social and cultural issues before we can lecture someone else on their country’s problems.
