We might not know the secret sauce used in your grandma’s favorite recipe. But what we do know about is the “secret sauce of innovation”. Now that we have your attention let's dive further into the topic.<br/>
Innovation has impacted various sectors of the economy like retail, banking, manufacturing, technology, etc.<br/>
In retail, the introduction of bar code scanners has made the process of billing very fast. We have all seen the shift from physical banks to online payments and e-wallets. There has been a rise in people using online payments to enable contactless transactions due to coronavirus.

E-commerce is also one of the major reasons that made people use E-wallets. Most of the retail shops are now accepting payments via e-wallets as well. The integration of innovation in the various aspects of the economy has definitely made our lives more convenient. <br/><br/>
Furthermore, various cryptocurrencies have been trending and being used worldwide. The latest blockchain technology has the potential to change the way we do transactions. The cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc have been the center of conversation on news and various social media platforms.
Moreover, the 5G network will enable high data transfer rates. Few countries have already been rolling out the installation of 5G towers. In the near future we might see 5G will overtake the 4G network.

In short, we can say that innovations had an overall positive impact and changed our lives for the better.  

#### Innovation
The invention is the conceptualization of an idea and implementation of that idea into the economy.

#### Innovation Model
We can see innovation as a journey, it moves from an idea to a destination which creates value for the users. In other words, it is a model for managing innovation. In the early days most of the innovations took place in manufacturing, but now the majority of innovations take place in the service sector. <br/>
To read more about the innovation model, please follow this link - https://bit.ly/3AELR1Y <br/>
Let us look at the various innovation models. <br/>

#### Technology Push Model - 
Scientists often make unexpected discoveries, and technologists find ways to develop product ideas from it. After that, engineers and designers turn it into prototypes for testing. This model is used to discover ways of producing the product efficiently. <br/>

###### Marketing and sales
Marketing and sales will promote the product to the consumer. In this model the marketplace is the passive recipient for the fruits of R&D. Basically, the idea comes from R&D which then goes to manufacturing, where the product is manufactured and brought to the market. From there it will go to the consumers. 

#### Market Pull Model - 
This is a customer need-driven mode that emphasizes the role of marketing as the initiator of new ideas. Resulting from closed interactions with the customers, these are conveyed to the R&D for design and engineering, then to manufacturing and production. In the fast-moving consumer goods industries, the role of marketing and customer feedback remains very influential. <br/>
This model is also known as the customer need-driven model, and it has come from the technology push model. Here the source will be the users. The users will provide their ideas according to their needs. These ideas in turn will be given to the R&D department. It designs and manufactures the products for efficient production. So that they will be sold in the market for the users. 

#### Simultaneous Coupling Model -
The simultaneous coupling of the knowledge within all the three functions will foster innovations. The 3 functions being R&D, marketing, and manufacturing. Furthermore, the point of origin of innovation is not known in advance. 

#### Interactive model -
This is a development of the simultaneous coupling framework linking both the technology push and the market pull frameworks. It emphasizes the interaction between the marketplace, science base, and organization capabilities. This framework illustrates that there is no clear starting point. This implies the innovation can be created from a variety of areas, this creates flexibility.<br/>
The target market can be observed, and focus groups can be set up to better understand consumer needs and expectations to gain customer insight.<br/>
In the company's examples as well, you have covered mostly the innovation initiative outcomes. There is a difference. I want to focus on how these companies are encouraging their employees to bring out innovative ideas. These companies have some news of running innovation initiatives.

Running innovation initiatives in a company requires a change in mindset, encouraging the different view, they have some platform to create knowledge repositories of ideas management, etc.

#### Two Pizza Model - 
Similarly, different companies have different models to run their innovation process. Amazon uses the “Two Pizza Model” which refers to having a team size that can be fed with two pizzas.

Two pizza model has various advantages - 
Smaller teams lead to effective communication among the team members. Small teams ensure effective communication between departments also. The members know which team to contact and collaborate with for the specific project. It simplifies the workflow and reduces the time taken by the team. Along with that, it also ensures the assignments are assigned according to the expertise <br/>

#### Skunkworks 
Skunkworks was a secret project that Lockheed Martin worked on. The project focused on  disruptive innovation in the field of aircraft. Leading specialists among the various branches are pooled together to research and develop highly innovative technologies. The project focuses on drastic improvements instead of incremental changes. The skunkworks project has a top-down power structure. The project manager has complete control over the project.

###### 3M
Employees can pursue a career in innovative companies because they provide forums to submit their innovative ideas. Innovative companies encourage their employees to give out-of-the-box suggestions. Using the collective intelligence of its employees, 3M has become the top innovative company. 

#### Innovation Outcomes
When it comes to implementing creative concepts and out-of-the-box ideas in the business. There comes a need to have an innovation model which documents the adoption process step by step. Moreover, we are going to discuss various innovation models of top companies. 

#### Tesla
Tesla is one of those unique companies that changed the narrative. It has shifted the attention from fuel-powered cars to electric cars. The company single-handedly brought electric vehicles into the spotlight. It has essentially revolutionized the car market.  It follows a very simple yet unique innovation model. 

Tesla has brilliantly divided its cars into two sections. One grabs the audience’s attention and aims for the headlines. This makes the company a synonym of cutting-edge technology in the market. The latest launch of the cyber track is one of those attention-gaining moves. While In the background, they focus on increasing the production and sales of their core cars which are models S, 3, X, and Y.  

Moreover, Elon Musk being CEO of Tesla leverages his previous successes of PayPal and SpaceX to win the trust of his investors. With his sarcastic and sometimes funny tweets, he has built up a likable image in front of his customers.

#### Amazon 
Amazon has successfully become an authority in the eCommerce niche. Which started as an online book store now is selling thousands of products in each category. Amazon’s innovative model is quite visionary. It sells the physical product at a cheap price and makes its money from the services provided on those physical products. It bears the loss in the short term and generates its profit over time. Kindle is the best example of this, where the customers are provided a tablet at an affordable price. The profit on kindle is made through the purchase of e-books by the customers over time.

#### IKEA
Ikea has become the most popular furniture brand in the world. Its innovation model focuses on the uniqueness of the product, which is portability and affordability. Ikeas understands its USP (unique selling proposition) and leverages it to its advantage. Ikea capitalized on the “Do it yourself” (DIY) furniture that can be delivered to customer’s homes. The unique furniture styles along with the convenience aspect made its products stand out.  


### The secret sauce of innovation 
#### Diverse Team 
It has been seen that the diversity in team members can be a good thing. Having a diverse set of individuals in a team will encourage out-of-the-box ideas. Moreover, effective communication and bonding among the team members can improve the overall efficiency of the team.

#### Think Differently 
Think different is the quote that the CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs made popular. Various companies have used it in different ways. Studies show that “thinking differently” is more like a muscle, you can develop it over time. Most of the market leaders have adopted this strategy, to create new innovative products like the iPhone. 

#### Setting aside the innovation fund
The companies must set aside funds for innovation. Ideally, it should be 1% to 3% of their overall investment. Research and development must be seen as investments to maximize its growth in the long term.

The companies that remain at the top keep continued innovation at the core of their marketing strategy. They keep improving their products regularly and aim at giving their customers the best possible product with the integration of a variety of cutting-edge technologies. This gives the customers a reason to buy their new releases, which makes them the market leaders. 

#### Fail Fast -
“Fail Fast” is the best advice that can be given to an entrepreneur. Fail fast refers to small failures that lead to big successes. Most of the big corporations that we see today, 
A number of decisions are taken in the big corporations, where it is close to impossible to predict the long-term impact. As long as the net outcome of all the decisions taken by you is positive, you will be making progress and moving forward. The point of the “Fail Fast” strategy is to make small failures that will eventually guide you to that one huge success. <br/>
To learn more about, “Fail Fast strategy” refer to this blog - (https://bit.ly/3hsIKCx)

#### Indian Jugaad  
Indian *‘Jugaad’* refers to utilizing the resources present in hand to get the job done. It doesn’t have to follow any set guidelines, but the project must be completed however possible. Skunkworks is one of the best examples of Indian ‘jugaad’, which was a division of Lockheed Martin, created to work on classified projects for the US air force.

#### Be Agile  
Small teams in innovation groups can do wonders rather than building a large team for one big innovation project. Give an example of the "Two Pizza" model of Amazon here.

Small teams bring agility to the workplace. It divides the big projects and assigns small sections to different teams. It promotes collaboration between the team and enhances the overall efficiency of the workplace.  

#### Innovation Models
We studied the various innovation models of the most innovative companies in the market. The conclusion is that the companies that focus on providing the customers a product that will indeed make their lives easier are more likely to succeed. Moreover, Amazon, IKEA, and Tesla all 3 companies have a great technical support infrastructure. They understand this important aspect that the only way to succeed is to bring value to your customers. 

These companies have gone the extra mile to meet the expectations of their customers. They realized that customer convenience is one of the most important factors. Thus they designed their products and infrastructure to maximize customer satisfaction. 

On the other hand, companies like Tesla understand the in’s and out’s of the market. They hacked the culture and successfully formed a sense of community around their products. Tesla is not just a car, it is a mission to make electronic vehicles mainstream. Along with the sense of community, Elon Musk ensured that the Tesla cars give the customers a futuristic feel with an autopilot and making the dashboard digital.

#### Summary 
We reviewed various innovation models used by the leading companies. There are a number of approaches when it comes to the implementation of various technologies. Every innovation model has its pros and cons, we can’t compare them directly. Furthermore, innovation models are very situational and dynamic, a proper understanding is required before adopting an innovation model.
