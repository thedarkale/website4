## 11 Proven ways to drive traffic to your website

Consistent growth is crucial for every business. Therefore, in this article, we will cover the most effective strategies to promote your business

##### 1. Create an online presence for your business
Most local business owners don’t give their businesses an online platform. It allows your business to reach a wider audience. In addition, businesses can provide their services online. It will lead to more sales which in turn will help them in becoming an authority in their niche. 

##### 2. Targeting Audience
Businesses should create content based on the search traffic potential. All businesses must implement SEO (search engine optimization) on the website content. SEO helps to create content that targets a specific audience. <br/>
The best topics to create content are those that merge high traffic potential, high business value, and low competition.

##### 3. Write guest posts
Guest posting on other blogs of your niche is one of the best ways to tap into new audiences. It allows your businesses to increase your exposure. Moreover, guest posting gives you a reason to form long-term ties with other blogs of your niche, which also helps you in building quality backlinks.

##### 4. Content promotion on various platforms
We should share the content in the relevant community on various social media posts. Facebook, Subreddits, Quora, and Youtube are the best ways to generate traction and reach a wider audience. 

##### 5. Appear on podcasts
Search for podcasts of your niche and appear on them. You can find your targeted audience and this will help form a community around your business. 

##### 6. Collaborate with other brands
Collaborate with others in a way that is beneficial for both brands. Promote other brands that solve unique problems for the same audience. It will give you access to an entirely new audience.

##### 7. Update content
Identify the content that is not doing well on your website and update it. We must keep the content up to date because Google doesn’t rank outdated articles. You will see a hike in the organic traffic on your articles after updating and republishing your blogs. 

##### 8. Merge similar posts
Merging two posts that aren’t performing well will boost their overall outreach. Both the posts had backlinks and SEO content. Therefore, when we combine them, it provides more value to the audience. 

##### 9. Repurpose your content
Use the written content and turn them into YouTube videos. We must organize the content in an easy-to-understand fashion. It is beneficial for your business in two ways. First, it will increase the organic traffic on your blog post. Second, creating an online presence on different platforms will tap into newer audiences.

##### 10. Creating content on Medium
Medium is a great platform to share your ideas on topics that don’t specifically target an audience. You can write about the crucial topics that are important but don’t have high search potential. <br/>
Firstly, this gives you a platform where you can engage with your audience at a deeper level. As well, it generates organic traffic to your blogs.
