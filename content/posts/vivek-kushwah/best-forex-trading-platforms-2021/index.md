Forex refers to foreign exchange; it is the place where currency trading on a global scale occurs. Forex trading happens in pairs; for example, someone will buy U.S. Dollars using an equivalent amount of British Pound. Here the USD acts as quote currency and British Pounds as the base currency, respectively. In simpler words, you are buying one currency by selling the other currency. It is generally represented as EUR/USD = 1.3, which shows that 1 euro is equivalent to 1.3 USD. Did you know that the entry barrier is shallow in online forex platforms? A person with an initial capital of 500-1000 U.S.D. can start a trading account.

#### Different types of Forex Trading Platforms

Did you know that there are different types of forex trading platforms? When it comes to forex trading, multiple options are available to traders that want to start trading in forex. We are going to learn about them below:

###### Dealing Desk

You have to be dealing with market makers. It is the market maker who takes the opposite side of your trade. They offer the brokers a fixed spread and trade in nano sets, which minimizes the risk. Market makers are suitable for beginner traders. Nano lots allow proper risk management.

###### Non-Dealing Desk

This trading is for experienced traders who have a good understanding of the market. But here, you have to create a larger size minimum as compared to Dealing Desk. In N.D.D., the spread is variable; the spread varies depending on the volatility in the market. Spread values fluctuate regularly based on economic announcements, shifts in global markets, and worldwide events of global importance. This volatility enables brokers to make a profit depending on their analysis and predictions of markets. N.D.D. Brokers usually take commissions on every forex trade and sometimes take a cut from the spread.

###### Straight Through Processing

In S.T.P., your broker is the link between you and other liquidity providers. The broker takes your order and routes it to a liquidity provider. S.T.P. brokers communicate with many liquidity providers. S.T.P. brokers have an extensive network of influential people and can help the broker make a successful forex trade portfolio.

###### Electronic Communication Network

E.C.N. takes the commission from each forex trade instead of taking a portion from the broker's spread. The broker is paying to access the liquidity provider and to interact with them. The prices or offers from various banks are provided by E.C.N. brokers, which keeps the interbank market transparent. E.C.N. brokers are unlikely to trade in nano lots, and thus only experienced traders are recommended to trade with E.C.N. brokers.

#### Why is choosing a forex trading platform important?

The number of online forex trading platforms increases, and all of them claim to offer excellent services to their customers. However, many brokers do not commit to their world. Before choosing an online forex platform, you should consider several factors. The following factors should be considered when selecting a forex trading platform:

###### Regulation

Regulation is the most important thing when it comes to selecting your forex trading platform. You must know by which agencies the broker is being regulated and whether those regulating agencies are legit or have credibility in the market. <br/>

Regulators put limits on the leverage offered by the brokers to perform proper risk management. The primary function of putting limits is to avoid drastic financial losses when a trade might go the other way. Regulations are also made that define eligibility criteria for firms. For example, firms in the U.S. must have a capital of 20 million USD. We will put down a list of well-known regulation agencies. It is as follows:

-   F.C.A. (Financial Conduct Authority) – It is a world-renowned regulating agency based in the U.K. regulating 58000 financial services firms.
-   CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) – It is an independent agency based in the U.S., it was founded in 1974. This agency's primary task is to regulate the U.S. derivatives markets.
-   NFA (National Futures Association) – It is a self-regulatory organization based in the U.S. Its function is to safeguard the integrity of the derivatives market.
-   M.A.S. (Monetary Authority of Singapore) – The agency mentions that its function is to maintain sustainable growth of the economy without inflation.
-   B.M.A. (Bermuda Monetary Authority) – Institution that regulates the financial aspect of Bermuda.

###### Customer Service

Customer service can be the deciding factor between you making money or losing money because of some glitch. You want to keep in mind that real money is at stake. So you must choose the online forex platform that you can approach via call or via live chat as soon as possible, in case of emergency. Use of e-mails is highly discouraged from getting an answer to your queries, as it is a time consuming process.

###### Ease of Withdrawal

You don't want an online forex platform that gives you more reasons than why you cannot withdraw your money. The reasonable time for money withdrawal will be around four to five business days. When withdrawals exceed that time frame, you should become very concerned. The money is ultimately yours, and you should be able to deposit and withdraw it whenever you want. If the forex platform offers you a bonus for keeping the money in the system, that can be a red flag also, and you might want to report to the respective authorities.

###### Security

Make sure you are not submitting your essential details to a fraudulent financial firm. There can be serious repercussions and possibly financial loss. If you don't know much about them, you should check with their previous clients and do some research on the internet. It's essential to check for regulating agencies as well. In addition, do not fall victim to any get rich quick scams offered by fraudulent forex trading platforms.

###### Trading cost

Trading costs can take a massive cut from your forex trade profits. Make sure to research the brokers that have low trading costs but still provide decent services. But on the other hand, brokers require funds to provide you services, so make sure you are the broker that hit the sweet spot between the trading cost and services. For traders that deal in high volumes, a high trading cost will negatively impact their overall profit from forex trade.

###### Conclusion

It is clear from the information provided in this article that Forex trading can be a profitable endeavour. Precautions certainly have to be taken while choosing your broker and forex trading platform. We listed the things that you should be aware of in a descriptive manner. We hope this will help you navigate through the random information present on the internet. <br/>

With the proper knowledge that we provided here, even a beginner will navigate his way in forex trading and through various forex trading platforms. Forex trading is not a piece of cake; it is not for everyone. Mostly first attempts, if not supervised, have high chances of being financially unsuccessful. To avoid any loss of money, people should carefully choose the online forex platform, which is a legit certified and regulated broker that can help you put your money in such a way that the risk of loss is significantly reduced. I.G. ( Investment Gold Index) is the most reliable online trading option. There have been cases where they refunded the loss of money due to technical issues from their side. The customer service of I.G. is unmatched, and in case of any problem, their customer support is just a call away. <br/>

They help you resolve the issue and initiate compensation if the issue resulted in financial loss. Still, some users might find the user interface of the I.G. Forex trading platforms are hard to understand and navigate.
