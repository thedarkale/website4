#### About us?

During the early 90's in the US the brewery (a barrel in which beer is processed) system flourished. The word darkale was used to describe a beer to make it slightly different from others. Based upon that same idea we as a team provide our readers writeups from immense topics. <br/>
We personally don't influence intoxication but make sure our words do intoxicate you in any manner.
