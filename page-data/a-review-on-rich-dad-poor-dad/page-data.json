Why is it often said that 'The Rich keep getting Richer and Poor keep getting Poorer',  'How to get Rich'? What are the secrets that the rich people have and the poor people don't know about? If you ever have pondered over such questions then this book will change the way you think. Robert T. Kiyosaki brings forth the lessons that he learnt in his life and tells you the reason as to why the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. The book title itself has been derived through his life and what he witnessed. The book talks about how the education system is failing to educate the students in necessary subjects and all this system has been created so that people don't ask questions and do what they are programmed to do. Kiyosaki talks about how important is financial education and explains to us how the Rich benefit with the right financial education which is lacking by the common 'poor' people who are stuck in the rat race of debt and loans. He talks about the importance of knowing the difference between assets and liabilities while exploring the ways taken by both rich and poor. He focuses on the mindset behind the same scenario and makes us realize what we have been doing wrong this whole time. And the best thing is we receive this financial education in form of a wonderfully forged story that relates to his life and starts from his childhood where he discovered the contrast difference in the way his biological father who is a Phd. thinks and how his friend Mike's father thinks who becomes his mentor later on and thus brings the concept of 'Rich Dad and Poor Dad'.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone should at least read this book once to at least have an idea of how the actual system works and this book may also help you form a basic foundation to gain success in life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-sources\" aria-label=\"additional sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggested song: </li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Have you ever wondered how the rich people got rich in the first place?
