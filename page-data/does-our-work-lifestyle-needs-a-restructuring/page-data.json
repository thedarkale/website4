If it is, don’t worry you are just a normal working class human tired of your daily routine and looking for “That One Opportunity” that might turn your life from a sad Halloween to happy Christmas.</p>\n<p>For generations this is how we are living lifestyle without taking time to evaluate ourselves. We simply pass this on to the next generation as we have been fed the same by our preceding ones. Maybe there is nothing wrong in it but maybe there is if you look at it. Why not be a horse every day rather be a pawn with too many restrictions. Yes, the horse too has its limitations but 2.5 steps is way better than 1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-what-about-i-hate-my-work-stuff\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#but-what-about-i-hate-my-work-stuff\" aria-label=\"but what about i hate my work stuff permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>But what about I hate my work stuff?</h2>\n<p>Just don’t think about how much you hate you work, think about why you chose to do it in the first place. Let it be if it were a dream or a necessity. That way you might find a push that you desperately needed and were waiting for someone to do it, or simply you were waiting for ‘That one Opportunity’ which would never arrive. All you need to do is not pity yourself. In this way you will end up motivating yourself along with creation of some group of envious personalities. But you can’t argue with the fact that in every seed of good there is always a piece of bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-thinking-like-a-plc-curve\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#try-thinking-like-a-plc-curve\" aria-label=\"try thinking like a plc curve permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Try thinking like a PLC Curve</h2>\n<p>Think of yourself as a product.
