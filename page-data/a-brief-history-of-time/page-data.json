That it considers every other theory?</p>\n<p>A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes by Stephen William Hawking analysis the possibility of one unified theory and why is it so emphasized. Being released more than three decades ago, the book never fails to astonish readers and is still acclaimed by physicists. The purpose of the book was to develop an understanding among readers who being from a non-physics background find it difficult to absorb such terminologies.</p>\n<p>From the birth of the universe to its most probable end, Hawking described every scenario in detail along with the graphical representation of certain terms. Be it Galileo Galilei’s belief in Copernican theory (that planets revolve around the sun), Newton’s Three Laws of Motion, The Four Laws of Thermodynamics, Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, or the Chandrasekhar Limit, Hawking managed to include every possible theory which explains and governs the universe. Hawking used pragmatic examples for many complicated terms which made it effortless to understand (like the example of gas molecules in a box to elucidate entropy; the example of a jigsaw puzzle to explain the second law of thermodynamics, etc.).</p>\n<p>The writing is more inclined towards conceptual and factual understanding unlike other books (as they focus more on storytelling) but doesn’t disappoint in any aspect and delivers more than it promises. Being an informative book, it takes time to build the reader’s understanding and then slowly furnishes its charisma which keeps the reader unconvinced until they finish the book. The book is a mountain of information that demands time and effort. It is very unlikely for anyone to understand everything on the first read but this is what makes the book a must-read as if offers something new every single time you read it again. </p>\n<p>I recommend this book to everyone who wishes to understand more about the universe and has a keen interest in knowing something new.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My Rating – 4.5/5 stars</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-sources\" aria-label=\"additional sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggested song: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RB-RcX5DS5A\">The Scientist - Coldplay</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"What if there is one unified theory that governs everything in the universe?
