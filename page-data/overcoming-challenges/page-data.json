Every path comes with its own unique set of challenges. It is always on us to have the right mindset while encountering them.\nChallenges vary from person to person and they change as we grow older. We all are unique and that’s what makes our challenges unique too. It is necessary to understand that it is always our choice to either face our challenges head-on or to avoid and procrastinate on them.\nEach challenge should be seen as an opportunity for growth. We need to keep improving ourselves and working on our flaws consistently getting better each day. </p>\n<h2 id=\"8-tips-to-overcome-challenges\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#8-tips-to-overcome-challenges\" aria-label=\"8 tips to overcome challenges permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>8 Tips to overcome challenges</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Challenges are part of the journey – Obstacles and challenges are necessary for our growth and improvement.

We need to change our attitude towards our challenges. Overcoming challenges boosts our self-confidence and we become a better version of our self. </li>\n<li>Take help –Don’t be hesitant on asking for help when you need it. Seek out help from others around you or through the internet.  Seeking help from others will make your challenge seem easier to overcome. </li>\n<li>Control the impulses – Impulsively reacting to challenges might make the problem seem even more complicated. It is best to approach challenges in a calm manner. Take time to think with a cool and collected mind, then make the best possible decision.</li>\n<li>One step at a time – The more you encounter challenges, the better you will become in solving them. Never be overwhelmed with the challenge your facing, focus on one thing at a time. With consistency, even the most difficult problems can be solved.</li>\n<li>Do not fear – While fear is also unavoidable just like challenges in life, we cannot let the fear overpower us. It makes us incapable of giving our best performance. It hinders with ability to think. Even in fear stay calm and continue taking steps in the right direction. </li>\n<li>Take rest – Every once in a while allow yourself to take a break. Breaks allow us to relieve physical and mental stress along with boosting our productivity. Take a 5-minute break to walk every once in a while. </li>\n<li>Read – Reading introduces us to new ideas and gives us a new perspective. It can be a good way to find the answers from people more experienced than you.

Overcoming the hardships of their personal and professional lives. </p>\n<p><strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong> – Also known as “The Rock”,  he comes from a very humble background. Recalling his struggle days he said, “I had 7 bucks in my pocket. I was dealing with depression and I couldn’t make myself get out of bed”. He was broke for most of his younger life. He said that remembering those hard times gives him perspective, humility and keeps him grounded. He said in one of his interviews to “put your back against the wall and push forward”. In his eyes facing challenges without giving yourself an option to back away has been his secret of success.<br/></p>\n<p>From a very young age, he played soccer on the school level. Later on, he continued his efforts to make a career in sports. All his plans of becoming a professional soccer player failed when he suffered a knee injury. Even in face of failure he kept himself calm and collected and started working on his body. “Our response to situations is the only thing that we can control” he later said. WWE gave him his first break in 1985, with the unique negative persona he grew popular among fans. His newfound fame gave him opportunities in Hollywood movies. And in 2013, after 11 years from his debut, he became the highest-earning Hollywood celebrity of the year. '\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“In 1995 I had 7$ in my pocket and I knew 2 things: I am broke as hell and one day I won’t be – The Rock”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>– The story of Oprah’s early years is heartbreaking. She came from poor family background. She was physically abused by her relatives from the age of 9 till 14. She gave birth at the young age of 14 to a premature baby that died later. She struggled all her life financially and didn’t even have clothes to wear. But all this didn’t break her. She excelled in her studies in high school and got a scholarship from a prestigious university. Managing part-time jobs along with the studies she completed her graduation in communication. She became the first black TV show host and raised her voice for issues of the black community. Her talk shows ratings were through the roof and she became a household name in America. She runs the most popular talk show in the industry which is dominated by white men. Oprah’s life shows us the power of will to change your life for the better. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“You get in life what you have the courage to ask for – Oprah Winfrey”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>- The electric car billionaire Elon Musk had a rough childhood. He shared his memories about his teenage years. Telling how he was bullied brutally to the point of getting admitted to the hospital. He was shy and didn’t know how to talk to people. Therefore he spent most of his time reading books and encyclopedias. “He was afraid of the dark till he learned that darkness is just the absence of photons,” he said. Having gained interest in coding he developed and sold his first game at the age of 12. After facing the divorce of his parents he moved to Canada for his graduation. He faced a lot of issues while staying in Canada he was not able to get a job. So he started working as a cleaner and helper on a farmhouse. He started his first internet-based company and coded thoroughly out the night while living in his tiny office. He recalls eating ramen noodles and fast food daily for dinner. After his first few successes, he started two new companies, Tesla and Space X. Both companies were on the verge of going bankrupt when the markets crashed in 2008. Along with that, he was also going through a very public divorce. He recalls that 2008 was the worst year of his life. But the tables turned and his companies started doing exceptionally well over time. All the challenges in his journey seemed worth it when he became the world’s richest man in January 2021 for a short period.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor – Elon Musk”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Challenges are inevitable in our lives and we must face them without fear and self-doubts. The people that have accomplished most in their lives have faced the most challenges. We saw the life stories of few individuals that are at the top of their industries. They all have one thing in common, not giving up when faced with challenges. If we want to become like them we need to do the same. We must force ourselves to come out of our comfort zone. Overcoming challenges and fighting our fears to reach greatness.</p>","timeToRead":5,"excerpt":"Overcoming Challenges Our day-to-day lives are filled with all sorts of challenges.
