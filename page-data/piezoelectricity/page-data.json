The word Piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from Pressure and Latent Heat. The word Piezoelectricity is derived from 2 Greek words  piezein which means to press or to squeeze and ēlektron which means amber, which was the ancient source of electric charge.</p>\n<p>French physicists Jacques and Pierre Curie are credited with the discovery of piezoelectricity in 1880.</p>\n<p>Hence, Piezoelectric effect is the generation of charges and accumulation in materials and this process is a reversible process as well. That means on the application of mechanical stress we can induce electric charge in the material and in an electric field we get the internal generation of mechanical stress.</p>\n<p>Now that we know about Piezoelectricity and what Piezoelectric Effect is we can understand about what are it's applications well.</p>\n<p>Piezoelectricity has numerous applications ranging from industrial and manufacturing of Piezoelectric devices, Automobile industries. Also it has various Medical applications involving instrumentation and surgical tools and Information and Telecommunications systems as well.</p>\n<p>Although Piezoelectricity is a fairly new concept and currently has very limited applications for now but there are numerous reaches being done on how can this concept be utilized furthermore for the advancement of various instrumentations and technology we have.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-sources\" aria-label=\"additional sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg
