My first encounter of heavy music was punk rock and I’ve heard only one band Green Day. This is a very strange thing around 2005 – 2010 a major chunk of Indian youth suddenly turned their ears to rock and metal and my brother was in college at that time, so that’s how a 10-year-old in 2008 from Indore was introduced to Ozzy, Iron Maiden and many other greats.</p>\n<p>The story metal started a very long time ago in the 1960s in Birmingham, England when a metal workshop worker named Anthony Frank Iommi famously named Tony Iommi cut his fingers in an accident while working. Cutting some pieces of his leather jacket he made fingertips for himself but still playing was difficult so he made adjustments to his guitar by detuning it, loosening the string tensions and created this heavy and powerful sound like no other. Tony described his incident as he “was told ‘you’ll never play again’. It was just unbelievable. I sat in the hospital with my hand in this bag and I thought, that’s it – I’m finished. But eventually, I thought ‘I’m not going to accept that. There must be a way I can play’.”</p>\n<p>The heaviness in the guitar was already there when most of the psychedelic and hard rock bands in the 1960s like ‘Cream’, ‘MC5’ and ‘Deep Purple’. Jimi Hendrix was also touring the world with his dextrous skills. So why Black Sabbath is credited with inventing heavy metal though firstly they considered themselves as a Hard Rock band? The Influences can also be traced back to the ‘Blues’ artists of the 50s and later the fast-paced American ‘Surf Rock’ of the 1960s, many other artists like ‘The Who’ and Eric Clapton’s ‘Cream’ were producing heavier songs, this new trend was also picked up by the ‘Beatles’ and they made ‘Helter Skelter’ in their album ‘The Beatles’ also known as ‘The White Album’.</p>\n<p>This new form became popular when two bands ‘Led Zepplin’ and ‘Steppenwolf’ came to the scene with Zepplin’s ‘Communication Breakdown’ a single from their debut album and Steppenwolf’s ‘Born to be Wild’ which even names ‘Heavy Metal Thunder’ in the lyrics but that wasn’t meant for the type of music they were playing, even then people picked up on that name and started associating it with this new sound.</p>\n<p>So when Black Sabbath came into the scene in 1969 with their self-titled album named ‘Black Sabbath’, starting from the album cover you can feel it's darker than other bands that were there, they used darker topics like witchcraft and talked about satan in their songs. Listening to the first riff of the song ‘Black Sabbath’ you get introduced to Tony Iommi paired with ‘Geezer Butler’ on the bass and the sound of the powerful pounding drums by ‘Bill Ward’ and then the eerie voice of ‘Ozzy Ozbourne’ and that’s how Sabbath is credited to kind of inventing Heavy Metal.</p>\n<p>Sabbath laid the groundwork by their debut and next two albums ‘Paranoid’ and ‘Master Of Reality’ which has all the great classic songs like ‘Iron Man’, ‘War Pigs’ and ‘Paranoid’ of course, 1971s ‘Master of Reality’ which was further detuned became a staple sound for ‘Heavy Metal’. The 1970s ‘In Rock’ by ‘Deep Purple’ also influenced many bands of the late 1970s.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-sources\"
