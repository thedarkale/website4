But what we do know about is the “secret sauce of innovation”. Now that we have your attention let's dive further into the topic.<br/>\nInnovation has impacted various sectors of the economy like retail, banking, manufacturing, technology, etc.<br/>\nIn retail, the introduction of bar code scanners has made the process of billing very fast. We have all seen the shift from physical banks to online payments and e-wallets. There has been a rise in people using online payments to enable contactless transactions due to coronavirus.</p>\n<p>E-commerce is also one of the major reasons that made people use E-wallets. Most of the retail shops are now accepting payments via e-wallets as well. The integration of innovation in the various aspects of the economy has definitely made our lives more convenient. <br/><br/>\nFurthermore, various cryptocurrencies have been trending and being used worldwide. The latest blockchain technology has the potential to change the way we do transactions. The cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc have been the center of conversation on news and various social media platforms.\nMoreover, the 5G network will enable high data transfer rates. Few countries have already been rolling out the installation of 5G towers. In the near future we might see 5G will overtake the 4G network.</p>\n<p>In short, we can say that innovations had an overall positive impact and changed our lives for the better.  </p>\n<h4 id=\"innovation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#innovation\" aria-label=\"innovation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Innovation</h4>\n<p>The invention is the conceptualization of an idea and implementation of that idea into the economy.</p>\n<h4 id=\"innovation-model\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#innovation-model\" aria-label=\"innovation model permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Innovation Model</h4>\n<p>We can see innovation as a journey, it moves from an idea to a destination which creates value for the users. In other words, it is a model for managing innovation. In the early days most of the innovations took place in manufacturing, but now the majority of innovations take place in the service sector. <br/>\nTo read more about the innovation model, please follow this link - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3AELR1Y\">https://bit.ly/3AELR1Y</a> <br/>\nLet us look at the various innovation models. <br/></p>\n<h4 id=\"technology-push-model--\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#technology-push-model--\" aria-label=\"technology push model   permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technology Push Model -</h4>\n<p>Scientists often make unexpected discoveries, and technologists find ways to develop product ideas from it.

In this model the marketplace is the passive recipient for the fruits of R&#x26;D. Basically, the idea comes from R&#x26;D which then goes to manufacturing, where the product is manufactured and brought to the market. From there it will go to the consumers. </p>\n<h4 id=\"market-pull-model--\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#market-pull-model--\" aria-label=\"market pull model   permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Market Pull Model -</h4>\n<p>This is a customer need-driven mode that emphasizes the role of marketing as the initiator of new ideas. Resulting from closed interactions with the customers, these are conveyed to the R&#x26;D for design and engineering, then to manufacturing and production. In the fast-moving consumer goods industries, the role of marketing and customer feedback remains very influential. <br/>\nThis model is also known as the customer need-driven model, and it has come from the technology push model. Here the source will be the users. The users will provide their ideas according to their needs. These ideas in turn will be given to the R&#x26;D department. It designs and manufactures the products for efficient production. So that they will be sold in the market for the users. </p>\n<h4 id=\"simultaneous-coupling-model--\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#simultaneous-coupling-model--\" aria-label=\"simultaneous coupling model   permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Simultaneous Coupling Model -</h4>\n<p>The simultaneous coupling of the knowledge within all the three functions will foster innovations.

It emphasizes the interaction between the marketplace, science base, and organization capabilities. This framework illustrates that there is no clear starting point. This implies the innovation can be created from a variety of areas, this creates flexibility.<br/>\nThe target market can be observed, and focus groups can be set up to better understand consumer needs and expectations to gain customer insight.<br/>\nIn the company's examples as well, you have covered mostly the innovation initiative outcomes. There is a difference. I want to focus on how these companies are encouraging their employees to bring out innovative ideas.
