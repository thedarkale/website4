Why as a child you could have bought <em>₹20</em> chocolate in <em>₹5</em> Why petrol is getting way expensive? why you have to pay more for your meal now than a decade ago? <strong>Inflation</strong> is the answer to the above questions.</p>\n<p>The basic definition of <strong>Inflation</strong> is <em>“a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time, when the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services”</em>. In simpler terms inflation is the upward movement in the overall price level of goods and services in the economy. It has the effect of devaluing a particular currency.</p>\n<p>Let take an example to understand this, Let's say you earn <em>₹110</em> and spends ₹100, then you are saving <em>₹10</em> and let's assume inflation rate is <em>3%</em> then next time you will spend <em>₹103</em> in your same ₹110 earning and your saving reduces to ₹7. That’s how inflation works.</p>\n<p>There are two major cause of inflation: <u>Demand-Pull</u> effect and <u>Cost-Push</u> effect. In <u>Demand-Pull</u> effect supply of money increases which stimulates people to buy more than the production capacity. This <u>Demand-Supply</u> gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. In <u>Cost-Push</u> inflation increase in prices of inputs like <u>Labour</u>, <u>Raw Material</u>, etc. The increased price of the factors of production leads to a decreased supply of these goods. While the demand remains constant, the prices of commodities increase causing a rise in the overall price level.</p>\n<p>Now let’s discuss why it not good to leave your money in saving account of your bank. Let’s say you have <em>₹100</em> in a savings account that pays a <em>1%</em> interest rate. After a year, you will have <em>₹101</em> in your account. But if the rate of inflation is running at <em>2%</em>, you would need <em>₹102</em> to have the same buying power that you started with. That’s how you lose your saving in Saving accounts. In India currently inflation rate is <em>3.75%</em> and <strong>SBI</strong> gives an interest of <em>2.70%</em> p.a. on its saving account. So, if you only keep money in your saving account do not invest in <u>Fixed Depots</u> (Current FD avg interest rates are 4.90%), <u>Mutual Funds</u>, <u>Equity</u>, Etc. Which have more interest rate than your saving account your money will be devaluing by rate of <em>1.05%</em>. Thats why it is now very important to invest your money in varies mediums.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-sources\" aria-label=\"additional sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggested song:</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Do you know we are getting poorer by every next minute?
