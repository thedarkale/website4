Forex trading happens in pairs; for example, someone will buy U.S. Dollars using an equivalent amount of British Pound. Here the USD acts as quote currency and British Pounds as the base currency, respectively. In simpler words, you are buying one currency by selling the other currency. It is generally represented as EUR/USD = 1.3, which shows that 1 euro is equivalent to 1.3 USD. Did you know that the entry barrier is shallow in online forex platforms? A person with an initial capital of 500-1000 U.S.D. can start a trading account.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-is-the-best-forex-trading-platform\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-the-best-forex-trading-platform\" aria-label=\"what is the best forex trading platform permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is the Best Forex Trading Platform?</h4>\n<p>Investment Gold Index is a financial services company founded in 1974, and it is a UK-based online forex platform.

However, many brokers do not commit to their world. Before choosing an online forex platform, you should consider several factors. The following factors should be considered when selecting a forex trading platform:</p>\n<h6 id=\"regulation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#regulation\" aria-label=\"regulation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Regulation</h6>\n<p>Regulation is the most important thing when it comes to selecting your forex trading platform. You must know by which agencies the broker is being regulated and whether those regulating agencies are legit or have credibility in the market. <br/></p>\n<p>Regulators put limits on the leverage offered by the brokers to perform proper risk management. The primary function of putting limits is to avoid drastic financial losses when a trade might go the other way. Regulations are also made that define eligibility criteria for firms. For example, firms in the U.S. must have a capital of 20 million USD. We will put down a list of well-known regulation agencies. It is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>F.C.A. (Financial Conduct Authority) – It is a world-renowned regulating agency based in the U.K. regulating 58000 financial services firms.</li>\n<li>CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) – It is an independent agency based in the U.S., it was founded in 1974. This agency's primary task is to regulate the U.S. derivatives markets.</li>\n<li>NFA (National Futures Association) – It is a self-regulatory organization based in the U.S. Its function is to safeguard the integrity of the derivatives market.</li>\n<li>M.A.S. (Monetary Authority of Singapore) – The agency mentions that its function is to maintain sustainable growth of the economy without inflation.</li>\n<li>B.M.A. (Bermuda Monetary Authority) – Institution that regulates the financial aspect of Bermuda.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 id=\"customer-service\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#customer-service\" aria-label=\"customer service permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Customer Service</h6>\n<p>Customer service can be the deciding factor between you making money or losing money because of some glitch. You want to keep in mind that real money is at stake. So you must choose the online forex platform that you can approach via call or via live chat as soon as possible, in case of emergency. Use of e-mails is highly discouraged from getting an answer to your queries, as it is a time consuming process.</p>\n<h6 id=\"ease-of-withdrawal\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ease-of-withdrawal\" aria-label=\"ease of withdrawal permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ease of Withdrawal</h6>\n<p>You don't want an online forex platform that gives you more reasons than why you cannot withdraw your money. The reasonable time for money withdrawal will be around four to five business days. When withdrawals exceed that time frame, you should become very concerned. The money is ultimately yours, and you should be able to deposit and withdraw it whenever you want. If the forex platform offers you a bonus for keeping the money in the system, that can be a red flag also, and you might want to report to the respective authorities.</p>\n<h6 id=\"security\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#security\" aria-label=\"security permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Security</h6>\n<p>Make sure you are not submitting your essential details to a fraudulent financial firm.
