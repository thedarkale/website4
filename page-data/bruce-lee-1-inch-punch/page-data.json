The move is looked up as an exercise to strengthen the power of punching. Being performed only at a range of 0-6 inches, it can generate a terrific amount of impact force. A 6-inch punch by Bruce Lee sent the man drifting 16 feet. That’s the power it could generate if properly trained.</p>\n<p>During a demonstration in History TV’s famous TV show ‘’Stan Lee’s Superhumans”, a Shaolin Monk named Shi Yan Ming showed his ability to one-inch punch over a human dummy. The result obtained was astonishing as the power generated was about 1.78 BC which was more severe than an injury obtained from a 30mile/hour car crash.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\"
