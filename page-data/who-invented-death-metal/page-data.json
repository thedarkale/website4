So my appetite was growing for more harsh stuff so one day I saw this catchy logo with swords in the background forming a pentagram on a youtube thumbnail the video was titled ‘Raining Blood – Slayer’ I was instantly hooked with the sheer power of that song and it opened up a huge world of extreme thrash and extreme metal in general for me.</p>\n<p>It is true the Slayer inspired a lot of bands to go more extreme and credit is far more given to their 1986 album ‘Reign in Blood’ but 1985s ‘Hell Awaits’ is also a huge winner for me with songs like ‘Kill Again’ and ‘Hell Awaits’ and not forgetting that horrifying album cover. Bands from the first wave of Black Metal like Venom and Celtic Frost also play a major part in influencing the death metal theme. But still what is the ground zero for Death Metal? The first Death Metal Album, this can be partly answered by the band ‘Possessed’ and their 1985 album ‘The Seven Churches’. Now, this album has all the ingredients of a death metal album the vocals, the riffs, and the tempo, anyone can easily say that it is the first death metal album, the main reason for that is the last song of the album ‘Death Metal’, yes the band named a song ‘Death Metal’ coining a new term just like Venom’s 1982 album ‘Black Metal’.</p>\n<p>Just at that time, a guy named Chuck Schuldiner was trading demo tapes all across the US with his heaviest and brutal sound under the band named ‘Mantas’ later name was changed to ‘Death’ and came up with ‘Scream Bloody Gore’ in 1987 and that album just defines the core theme of a death metal sound, thrash metal riffs are tight and death metal is a raw punch in the face.</p>\n<p>So this is another opinionated answer, early black metal bands and Slayer opened the gateway, Possessed made the bridge and Death finished the work.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Who invented Death Metal?
