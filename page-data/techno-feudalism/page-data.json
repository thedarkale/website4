These are recent instances which shows how countries are now making strict regulations over tech giants over their services. But why?? Well the answer to this lies way back in the era when king queen use to rule their kingdom.</p>\n<p>Late between 9th and 15th centuries king give their powers to his fellow followers in the form of gifts. Later on after the king rule ended countries got divided themselves into independent nations. Government was formed which led to people relying on the principle of <em>Rule of Law</em> eventually constitution was framed and powers were delegated on different level.</p>\n<p>But now the scenario has changed after the internet came into existence. Tech giants are now ruling the cyber real estate as per a new study by <em>Yanis Varoufakis</em>, Greek-Australian economist and politician. As per his theory FAANG are building a fedulistic society. In the 21st Century there has been Tech aristrocracy: they have technology, money, unprecedented computing power with a peculiar character of inequality. A technical aristrocracy has been created by techo giants like <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Amazon</em>, <em>Apple</em>, <em>Netflix</em>, <em>Google</em>. They are creating an environment where only they want to rule.</p>\n<p>The top teach companies are creating monopoly over in their respective fields there has instances wherein the Competition Commision of <strong>USA</strong> has filed a case against <em>Facebook</em> for performing unfair practices. They will keep updating their system and will lead the world through their own unpresidented power. <br/></p>\n<h6 id=\"additional-resources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a
