Government divided the vaccination drive into different phases. In the 1st phase, health workers engaged in Covid-19 duty along with other essential frontline workers were covered. 2nd phase of the drive started on March 1, all senior citizens aged more than 60 years and those in the age group of 45-59 years with co-morbidities were eligible for vaccination. Tomorrow, on 1st April 3rd phase started, Under Phase 3 of the vaccination drive, the government is targeting to cover all people aged more than 45 years. According to the government, now more than 65 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered so far. On Thursday, the government said it administered more than two million doses in the past 24 hours. Currently, two vaccines are given the green light - one developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University (Covidshield) and one by Indian firm Bharat Biotech (Covaxin). Several others candidates are at different stages of trials.</p>\n<p>Now let’s understand the two vaccines which are used in India.\nCovidshield: - AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 marketed as Covidshield is developed by the university of oxford. In India, it is locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), which the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness.</p>\n<p>When the vaccine is injected into a patient body, it triggers the immune system to start making antibodies against that virus and it primes to fight against the coronavirus infection. The vaccine is administered in two doses taken between four to eight weeks. Covidshield vaccine has been approved for restricted use in an emergency in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of Covidshield as seen in a clinical trial is between 62 – 90%. Its effectiveness is depending on many factors, one of them is the time between two doses. According to SII, Covidshield is “highly effective” which can be backed by a phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil and UK.</p>\n<p>Side effects that have been reported with the Covidshield vaccine include:\nVery Common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nesTenders, pain, warmth, redness, itching, swelling or bruising where the injection is given</li>\n<li>Generally feeling unwell</li>\n<li>Feeling tired (fatigue)</li>\n<li>Chills or feeling feverish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling dizzy</li>\n<li>Decreased appetite</li>\n<li>Abdominal pain</li>\n<li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li>\n<li>Excessive sweating, itchy skin, or rash</li>\n</ul>\n<p>COVAXIN: - BBV152 marketed as COVAXIN is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. In inactivated virus-based vaccine patient is injected with a vaccine that consists of a deadly virus, that deadly virus does not cause the diseases but triggers the immune system to make antibodies against that virus. So, COVAXIN is consists of a dead coronavirus virus when administered, immune cells recognize the dead virus, prompting the immune system to make antibodies against the pandemic virus. </p>\n<p>COVAXIN is also administered in two doses which are given four weeks apart. It can be stored at 2c to 8c temperature. Covaxin, has an efficacy rate of 81%, preliminary data from its phase 3 trial shows.</p>\n<p>Side effects that have been reported with the Bharat Biotech COVID-19 (COVAXIN) include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Injection site pain / Swelling / Redness / Itching</li>\n<li>Headache</li>\n<li>Fever</li>\n<li>Malaise/body ache</li>\n<li>Nausea</li>\n<li>Vomiting</li>\n<li>Rashes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other candidates which are in different stages of trials in India to test safety and efficacy include:</p>\n<p>\tZyCov-Di, being developed by Ahmedabad-based Zydus-Cadila\n\tA vaccine being developed by Hyderabad-based Biological E, the first Indian private vaccine-making company, in collaboration with US-based Dynavax and Baylor College of Medicine\n\tHGCO19, India's first mRNA vaccine made by Pune-based Genova in collaboration with Seattle-based HDT Biotech Corporation, using bits of genetic code to cause an immune response\n\tA nasal vaccine by Bharat Biotech\n\tThe Sputnik V vaccine candidate developed by Dr Reddy's Lab and Gamaleya National Centre in Russia\n\tA second vaccine being developed by Serum Institute of India and American vaccine development company Novavax</p>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"Here is all you need to know about vaccine in India\nIn
