Doesn’t matter who we are, something always happens that is outside our control. It could be something with your family, economy, or career.\nHow we are going to mold this to turn our life around because when you come up with a new meaning, you get a new life.\nAsk yourself what the (correct wording) is one power that can change your life at this moment.\nWe all have it, this one power that can change anything in life regardless of what’s happened to us. It is the power of choice. We can’t control the events, but we can choose what to focus on. You can choose what it means to you. These choices and decisions that we make control our lives. It is not so much the conditions of our life that control our destiny as much as the decisions that we take.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-the-power-of-choice-is-important\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-the-power-of-choice-is-important\" aria-label=\"why the power of choice is important permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why the power of choice is important?</h2>\n<p>We can look back on specific decisions that if we would have made differently, our whole life would be different.

So, there is no right or wrong since youhave the choice of how you see them. Everything in our life changes the moment we decide. It has to be anactual decision. An actual decision is when you cut off any other possibility and you commit to somethingwith everything you got. Take action, but the big decision start with little decisions, like what we focuson in day-to-day life. <br/>\nWhatever you are going to focus on, you’re going to feel. If you focus on how this world and the people are bad you will see that. If you focus on the good things, you will see good things. Everything depends on what we choose to focus on.</li>\n<li>Conscious Decisions\nThe secret is you have to become conscious about your decision-making.  If you want to change your life you have to make suitable choices. New life comes from choices. Make conscious choices in your day-to-day life. <br/>\nIf noticed carefully, we see that most people take their decisions unconsciously. We spent most of their   lives on autopilot. When you are conscious, you decide and decide what to focus on and what things mean to   you. When you are unconscious, you get pretty terrible results. If you want to change your results you have   become more conscious of your decision-making.</li>\n<li>Choose the meaning of things\nYou get to decide is this the end or is the beginning. Because once you give it a meaning it becomes a truth for you. If you think this is the end, it will be the end and vice versa.\nLittle choices like what to believe about yourself, or what to believe about others affect your whole life.\nWe decide to quit because it is overwhelming, or we decide to focus and turn it around. Ultimately, our   destiny is determined by what we do.<br/>\nYour destiny is determined by your decisions. You focus on finding the solution like this is the ultimate  battle.\n<br/> Be committed to positive change, and be assertive in your decisions. That doesn’t guarantee that you’re going to succeed but when you have that kind of mindset enhances the possibility. You must commit to get a result and put all your intentions and focus into something. Have the right strategy to execute. \nPractice your power of choice in your day-to-day life.\n<br/> It is the only way to get better at it. Observe in  your life what are the things that you are doing subconsciously and replace them with conscious decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6 id=\"what-are-the-most-important-choices-in-lifebr\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-are-the-most-important-choices-in-lifebr\" aria-label=\"what are the most important choices in lifebr permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What are the most important choices in Life?<br/></h6>\n<p>Works and relationships take a major portion of a person’s life. One must make these choices diligently. What you are will be attracted to in your life. You must use your power of choice while choosing your work and relationships.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Work - Our work defines us, what we do in our lives, reflects who we are. Work is not just something that you do to make a living. It is an expression of your being. You must choose a type of work that elevates you and pushes you out of your comfort zone.</li>\n<li>Relationships - While choosing whom you allow in your life. You must ask yourself what values you see in the other person, that you would like to inculcate in your own life. List the things about them that make you respect them. And based on this you should choose whether a person will elevate you or drag you down.  </li>\n<li>Lifestyle – When you get up, when you go back to sleep needs to be fixed. You cannot let your subconscious take decisions for you. You must bring order in your life and make conscious decisions for yourself throughout the day.  </li>\n<li>Company – It is an old saying “you are the sum total of the people you hang out with”. Pick your company wisely. Seek individuals that can elevate you to the next level. You have to consciously limit your time to the people that don’t want to move ahead in their lives. </li>\n<li>Habits – “Hard work beats talent every time”. Getting your life back in order is not a sprint it is a marathon. You would have to choose discipline each moment of your life. Inculcate productive habits in your life and quit the unproductive ones. </li>\n<li>Self Development – Your personal growth must be the main priority of your life. Throughout the day keep asking yourself whether this is making me grow or not.  You have to constantly push yourself out of your comfort zone.</li>\n<li>Work Out – Physical activities improve brain functioning. It clears you to take firm decisions in your life. Working out doesn’t have to be a 2-hour gym session. It can also be a brisk walk around the block or taking your dog for a walk.  </li>\n<li>Growth mindset - Even the failure when perceived correctly is just an opportunity for growth. The mindset defines the destiny of a person’s life. We are moving ahead in life or regressing backwards there is no in between. <br/></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>Your power of choice can upgrade or destroy you depending on your mindset</em>\"\n― Dr. Jacinta Mpalyenkana</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>We are always taking decisions, whether we realize it. This article will make you realize the power of choice. We all have it, but not all of us use it for our benefit. For most of us, we find our brains are always working either consciously or subconsciously. Coming up with thoughts or thinking about future possibilities. People might find them over thinking about the tiniest of the problems. There is just one way to resolve all these issues that is Power of Choice.<br/>\nWhether the situations are good or bad, you always have the choice that dictates how we process them. We cannot control the situations in our life, but we can always control how we respond to them. We must well think our response to each situation out instead of impulsive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>Only you can decide what you become</em>\"\n-Seth Adam</p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":5,"excerpt":"Realizing Power Of Choice Everybody experiences stress in their life.
