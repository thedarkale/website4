The main theme of economic survey as stated in preface of survey is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23savinglives%26livelihoods\">#savinglives&#x26;livelihoods</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vshapedrecovery\">#vshapedrecovery</a> of economy. The economic survey provides us how the <u>COVID19</u> virus impacted us and how India improving from it. It also project India’s gross domestic product growth for 2021-22.</p>\n<p>Some key highlight points from economic surveys are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Economic survey supports the India's strict early lockdown in march 2020.it states that an early, intense lockdown provided a win-win strategy to save lives, and preserve livelihoods via economic recovery in the medium to long-term.</li>\n<li>The survey presents a V-shaped recovery, as seen in a 7.5% decline in GDP in Q2 and recovery across all key economic indicators vis-à-vis the 23.9% GDP contraction in Q1.</li>\n<li>The survey expects India’s real GDP to record an 11.0% growth in FY2021-22 and nominal GDP to grow by 15.4% – the highest since independence: This means that the Indian GDP in 2021-22 is expected to be at ₹149.2 lakh crore.</li>\n<li>The survey points out that the economy is recovering during the second half of this year. The recovery in the second half of FY2020-21 is expected to be powered by government consumption, estimated to grow at 17% YoY. Exports expected to decline by 5.8% and imports by 11.3% in the second half of the FY21.</li>\n<li>Agriculture set to cushion the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy in FY21 with a growth of 3.4% and Industry &#x26; services estimated to contract by 9.6% and 8.8% respectively during FY21.</li>\n<li>The economic survey also supports the newly introduced farm laws, it has said that farm laws will be beneficial for small and marginal farmers and herald a new era of market freedom which can go a long way in the improvement of farmer welfare in India.</li>\n<li>Through survey it is expected that Healthcare takes the centerstage in the Budget as COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the importance of the healthcare sector and its inter-linkages with other sectors – showcased how a health crisis transformed into an economic and social crisis. India's health infrastructure must be agile so as to respond to pandemics.</li>\n<li>The survey states that a regulator for the healthcare sector must be considered given the market failures stemming from information asymmetry Mitigation of information asymmetry will help lower insurance premiums, enable the offering of better products and increase insurance penetration.</li>\n<li>The Economic Survey made a case for ramping up investments in R&#x26;D as India’s gross domestic expenditure on R&#x26;D (GERD) is lowest amongst top ten economies. Indian resident’s share in total patents filed in the country must rise from the current 36% which is much below the average of 62% in top ten economies</li>\n<li>Monthly GST collections of India have crossed the Rs. 1 lakh crore mark consecutively for the last 3 months, reaching its highest levels in December 2020 ever since the introduction of GST.
