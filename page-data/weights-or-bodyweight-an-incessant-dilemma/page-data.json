I have that too from time to time with my friends. Although in technical sense there are four types of basic training methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Free Weights Exercise</li>\n<li>Weight Machines</li>\n<li>Body Weight Training</li>\n<li>Cardio Workout</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But for the sake of comparison I've merged 1. and 2. point into Weights because they both need some kind of weighted equipment to maneuver. Also point 3. and 4. have been merged to Bodyweight since it requires nothing but your body to build strength and endurance.</p>\n<p>I'm not here to tell you what to do or what are the methods of doing these exercises. I'm here to establish a school of thought. Where? Inside you, yes! So you can take rational decisions while considering all the below mentioned points and make yourself your own exercise program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"body-weight-training\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#body-weight-training\" aria-label=\"body weight training permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Body Weight Training </h2>\n<p>Does strength really mean big and bulky?

Are you doing to lose weight, etc.</li>\n<li>Training Reason: If you're learning martial arts you should choose body weight. If you're a trainer it depends on what you're teaching.</li>\n<li>Best Match: It also depends on the body type and genetics like some people have fast flexor muscles some have slow. Fast flexor will give you advantage in bodyweight exercise and competations and vice-versa.</li>\n<li>Convenience: Are you doing this part time or you're giving this whole of your day.</li>\n<li>Hobby: If you're a climber or boulderer or like calisthenics you should probably go to bodyweight. If you want to do weight lifting you'd choose weights.</li>\n<li>Progression: You like to see quick progressions you should do weights.</li>\n<li>Performance: If you want to increase your strength in a short time you can go with weights.</li>\n<li>Looks: If you want to look good, toned muscular body you can go with weights.</li>\n<li>Posture: If you're recovering from some injury or you want a good posture then you should go with body weights.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So... what's the final verdict? The answer is there isn't any, despite from the experience level you should do both or weighted body exercise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"additional-sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-sources\" aria-label=\"additional sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggested song: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bpOSxM0rNPM\">Do I Wanna Know? - Arctic Monkeys</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"Bros have always been debating for which is the better way to train your body, is it bodyweight exercise or is it weighted exercise.
