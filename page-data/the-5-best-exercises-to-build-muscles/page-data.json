Especially, during quarantine, we need to move more. The best part is your stress hormone, adrenaline and cortisol will go down. Moreover, you’ll feel better because your body is now happy as it has got what is needed. Endorphine is released during exercise which elevates your mood and then you can focus on your work better.</p>\n<p>The fitness goal of most people nowadays is to get strong and aesthetic. To achieve it you have to focus on the three basic pillars of fitness which are workout, sleep and diet. While most people want a shortcut, some people want to do it in an old school way. What the masses don’t know is there is no shortcut to building a Captain America or Black Widow physique. The only way is to do hard work and be consistent with a good diet. Doing hard work not only makes you a real-life superhero but also its whole lot of fun to do. People often get addicted to exercise or their favourite sport because that’s how our body is evolved. Ancient hunters and gatherer used to walk and hunt a lot, the way we’ve evolved is completely opposite to today’s sedentary lifestyle. The human body is programmed to move and eat a lot not to sit and eat less. Now that you got the idea that exercise is good for mental and physical health.

The muscles involved are hamstrings, glutes, inner thigh muscles, core, lower back, traps, quads, rhomboids, erector and obliques.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-pull-ups\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-pull-ups\" aria-label=\"5 pull ups permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5.
