A lot of buzz is going around these days with events like “Friday’s for future” started by Greta Thunberg, focusing mainly on the evil acts of the corporations. But there are other hidden factors that we need to address on high a priority. The following will be the list of such factors-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Population growth – Our tendency to breed more and more, is one of the major causes of climate change, with each child that is born today we are putting ourselves in harm’s way. Earth is not able to sustain 7 billion people, and furthermore the scientist predicts that with the current trajectory, there will be 9 billion humans by 2050 and 11 billion by 2100. This trend of population growth must slow down or this planet will become scarce of resources, resulting is mass deaths by famine, droughts , scarcity of water and other natural calamities that will result in complete destruction of the civilization as we know it today.</li>\n<li>Meat and Dairy Industry – It is a known fact that 80 percent of the agricultural land is used to grow harvest for the domestic animals occupied by the dairy industry and meat industry. Without talking about all the suffering and exploitation that animals have to bear, the main thing we need to address is the amount of green house gases that are produced from these industries. Our inability to resist the temptation of eating meat and milk products will become the major cause our destruction.</li>\n<li>Consumerism – In today’s world the consumerism is linked with happiness. The morals of a common man have been driven by this idea that you can buy happiness. This massive marketing campaign of the big corporations has made us believe that we can bring home the happiness in form of their products and services. The celebrities and influencers of today’s generation reflect the same ideology, the more fame or money you get the better you are doing in life. There is a need of shift in morals of people on the fundamental level, making them aware that once quality of life is not solely dependent on money or material possessions.</li>\n<li>Capitalism – The root cause of capitalism is consumerism, in recent years a lot of activism is done around “how big corporations are responsible for killing our planet” but the thing that they missing is that we are funding these big corporations. We allowed them to become this big corporate giant that they are today by buying their products and services. The blame game or pointing fingers at each other is not going to give us a useful solution for this challenge of climate change that we all are facing right now, there is a major need to self reflect on our own morals and beliefs.</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"In order to provide the issue we need to first understand it in depth.
