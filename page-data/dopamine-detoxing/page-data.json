For this to happen you need to abstain from all sort of pleasurable activities that you engage in. By doing so your cravings will drive you to achieve that objective and that‚Äôs what it is. Your cravings like Watching Pornographic content, eating fast food, chocolate, Scrolling Instagram etc. all sort of things generates high Dopamine and Serotonin which helps you in releasing a lot of these hormones. But when you reach to an extent wherein you don‚Äôt find anything motivated then you‚Äôve a problem of Dopamine deficiency. So, in order to counter this problem of mine this is what I did so in a week of 7 days I un-installed my Instagram though I don‚Äôt have much following on it üòâ. I made this strategy whatever I‚Äôm going to do in that whole week may it be attending online classes, working on some case, learning Spanish lessons etc. I‚Äôll abstain from engaging in any sort of high dopamine activities like no Instagram, Snapchat and not even porn. Now on the sixth day that is Saturday I‚Äôll give myself a dose of Instagram scrolling. And I know this might seems silly but then I started doing this I started using that craving of mine as a drive in which I was going crazy. No matter how harsh the situations might be you just don‚Äôt use Instagram as a Dopamine source. Completion of that work give you a sense of accomplishment and that happy feeling which is of course long lasting. Our generation where everyone is in demand of instantaneous results it may be relationships, your carrier, or even food delivery Remember whatever photos is been depicted on it is very charming and good. It gives you a perception of lavish and good life. But life doesn‚Äôt work that way every one deserves to be at best Position but not everyone gets there. You need to earn it in order to be at that position. Also, the true purpose of life is to know oneself first not what others want you to be that what makes the difference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-counter-this-problem\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-counter-this-problem\" aria-label=\"how to counter this problem permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to counter this problem?</h2>\n<p>During lockdown in May, I use to wake up at 4 in the morning for me that time was the best when I can seek for opportunities and can grow as a person and after that I use to study contract law on Harvard Course. After which I use to meditate or do Pranayama at 6 in the morning. Talking about meditation you might have done some tough task throughout your life but sitting quietly for 5 minutes was way too tough for a young guy like me. Initially it was tough to even sit, just ‚Äúsitting‚Äù and later the straight posture and closing the eyes added salt to the pain. But somehow it came into habit after doing it for almost 3 weeks. After meditating consistently for almost a month I felt a sense of fulfilment in me. The FOMO part in me which I felt after viewing someone‚Äôs story or liking someone‚Äôs pic was kind of vanished. After 3 months of no social media. I installed my Instagram and somehow, I felt I am not feeling the pleasures like I use to do before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By concluding I would like to associate a famous quote the words of Steve Jobs ‚ÄòStay Hungry Stay Fullish‚Äô by staying hungry I meant to say keep your cravings may it be masturbation, scrolling social media, eating your favourite food etc a medium of motivation which will help you complete you daily tasks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Internet is a boon and so is social media but don‚Äôt let those attention seeking platform ruin your life.
