After four explosive attempts at high-altitude test flights, now starship can be successfully launched and landed. <br/>\nAccording to Elon Musk, SpaceX will land humans on Mars by 2026. The question is why Elon musk and scientists think that Mars is the chosen planet for the next human civilization. As I researched this topic, I find out the prominent reasons Mars is our choice.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reason-1-is-temperature\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-1-is-temperature\" aria-label=\"reason 1 is temperature permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 1 is Temperature:</h4>\n<p>At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one of Earth's closest neighbours. Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight.<br/>\nMars has a sixth of the pressure on Earth’s atmosphere so, the planet doesn’t keep the heat very long, causing temperatures to drop. Mars is cold—its average global temperature is around -62.2222 degrees Celsius.<br/>\nFor the temperature problem on Mars, a scientist has come up with a plan. If we create an atmosphere thick enough to stop the heat from dissipating into space. We would increase the atmospheric pressure and create the basics necessary for terraforming the planet. Hope for increasing the temperature of the red planet, this is one reason to choose Mars.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reason-2-there-is-water-present-on-mars\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-2-there-is-water-present-on-mars\" aria-label=\"reason 2 there is water present on mars permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 2 There is water present on Mars:</h4>\n<p>New findings from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provide the strongest evidence yet that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars. Liquid water appears to flow from some steep, relatively warm slopes on the Martian surface.<br/>\nAccording to NASA scientists, “vast deposits of water appear to be trapped within the ice caps at the north and south poles of the planet. Each summer, as temperatures increase, the caps shrink slightly as their contents skip straight from solid to gas form. In winter, cooler temperatures cause them to grow to latitudes as low as 45 degrees, or halfway to the equator. The caps are an average of kilometres thick and, if completely melted, could cover the Martian surface with about 5.6 meters of water.”<br/></p>\n<p>Now proposed theories to access that water is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Microwaving Mars:\nThe most obvious method for extracting water would be to dig up the frozen soil and bake it in an oven until the water vaporizes. But it is less efficient and requires a lot of digging, making it more difficult to access water.</li>\n<li>Of course, Mars isn't the only place scientists hope to find and my water; the moon and asteroids are also prime targets.</li>\n<li>Elon Musk has suggested, for example, that we could terraform Mars and also get water by exploding nuclear bombs over its polar caps. The heat release would vaporize the frozen carbon dioxide to greenhouse warm the planet and melt the water ice. According to him, radiation wouldn’t be an issue since the explosion would be in space over the poles. <br/>\nThe possibility of having Available water on Mars makes the idea of having human civilization on Mars more realistic.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"reason-3-abundance-of-cosub2sub\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-3-abundance-of-cosub2sub\" aria-label=\"reason 3 abundance of cosub2sub permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 3 Abundance of CO<sub>2</sub>:</h4>\n<p>Mars’ atmosphere is 96% carbon dioxide, making it impossible for a human to live. Plenty of carbon dioxide is useful in many aspects. Like it helps in making the process production of oxygen on Mars very easy.<br/>\nAn accessible method of producing oxygen on Mars is a must for human survival. Oxygen is also a crucial ingredient in most rocket fuels. NASA estimates that to get four astronauts’ home from Mars would take about 25 tonnes of oxygen. It is expensive to carry anything to Mars and rockets have limited capacity, so every gram counts. <br/>\nOne of the objectives of the recently launched Perseverance, NASA’s newest six-wheeled robot on the Martian surface, is to Extracts First Oxygen from Red Planet.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reason-4-possibility-of-farming-and-food-production-on-mars\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-4-possibility-of-farming-and-food-production-on-mars\" aria-label=\"reason 4 possibility of farming and food production on mars permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 4 Possibility of farming and food production on Mars:</h4>\n<p>The storable food from Earth will only serve as emergency rations. It means the astronauts will try to eat as much fresh food that they produce on Mars as possible. Mars's atmosphere is CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements.it means that we can grow plants on Mars by compressing the atmosphere. <br/>\nResearch suggests Martian soil has some nutrients plants need to grow and survive. Also, studies suggest that watering plants on Mars could need less water than on Earth. That is because water would flow differently through the Martian soil, thanks to the Red Planet’s gravity, which is approximately 38% that of Earth’s. <br/>\nIn other words, anything on Mars would feel about three times lighter than on Earth. Therefore, under Martian gravity, the soil can hold more water than on Earth, and water and nutrients within the soil would drain away more slowly.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reason-5-availability-of-enough-sunlight-on-mars\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-5-availability-of-enough-sunlight-on-mars\" aria-label=\"reason 5 availability of enough sunlight on mars permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 5 Availability of Enough Sunlight on Mars:</h4>\n<p>Mars's greater distance from the Sun means that the maximum intensity (brightness) of sunlight on Mars is much less (about 44%) than that on Earth. There is enough sunlight to power the solar panels which will eventually become our primary source of power in the early phase of human settlement on Mars. Sunlight also helps in the terraforming of Mars.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reason-6-gravity-on-mars-is-38-that-of-our-earts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-6-gravity-on-mars-is-38-that-of-our-earts\" aria-label=\"reason 6 gravity on mars is 38 that of our earts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 6 Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Eart's:</h4>\n<p>Space is an extreme environment for the human body, where during long-term missions’ microgravity and high radiation levels represent major threats to crew health. Variations of gravity bring about numerous changes in humans, ranging from metabolism to changes in more conservative systems. <br/>\nGravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt. Mars gravity also help in lift heavy things, massive structure and bound around.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reason-7-days-on-mars-are-remarkably-close-to-that-of-earth\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reason-7-days-on-mars-are-remarkably-close-to-that-of-earth\" aria-label=\"reason 7 days on mars are remarkably close to that of earth permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reason 7 Days on Mars are remarkably close to that of Earth:</h4>\n<p>Mars is a planet with a very similar daily cycle to the Earth. Its sidereal day is 24 hours, 37 minutes, and 22 seconds and its solar day is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds. A day on Mars is roughly 40 minutes longer than a day is here on Earth.<br/>\nCompared to other bodies in our Solar System where a day is either incredibly short (Jupiter rotates once on its axis every 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 29.69 seconds) or incredibly long (a day on Venus lasts for 116 days and 18 hours). This helps in the planning of future missions and an easy to the adept environment for humans.<br/>\nUltimately there are two planets in orbits near the Earth are our Moon and Venus. Venus is absolute hell. The average temperature is over 400 degrees, the barometric pressure is that of 900 meters underwater on Earth. The cherry on top comes in the form of occasional bouts of acid rain. It also has nights that last for 120 days.<br/>\nConclusion is human can’t survives on Mars without technology and even with technology it will be an absolute struggle, but when compared with the other planets that accessible for the earth to have a civilization, Mars is definitely paradise.</p>","timeToRead":5,"excerpt":"Reasons Elon musk thinks Mars can be our second Earth?
