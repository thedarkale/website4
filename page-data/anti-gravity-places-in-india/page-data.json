Many individuals have also experienced an upward pull in the area. Another theory that contradicts the above theory has arrived which explains all the events happening as an optical illusion. The illusion makes downhill look like an uphill. While there may be many theories among tourists and experts, locals believe that the road is a straight path to heaven, and only the deserving experience an upward pull.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason may be, these places must be added to every traveler’s list.
