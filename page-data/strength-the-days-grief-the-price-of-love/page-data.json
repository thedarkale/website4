I felt lonely, didn't have anybody to sit next to at lunch, vulnerable from just the look of others. I was lonely and sad and with no surprise that happened again from time to time when I changed cities, moved to a new place to live, new culture to adjust myself with, a change of job and much more to come in my life from now.</p>\n<p>But I also remember when my parents were there to pick me up and how hard I cried due to the anguish I went through in these few hours of separation. These memories along with many more make it hard to wrap my head around the idea when my parents are going to be no more and much less today where I can write on this.</p>\n<p>Past few months I got to know about the loss of many people's family members and the most profound of them which hit me the most is stage 4 brain cancer which my friend's (let's call that friend <strong>SA</strong>) father is diagnosed with. And the first-hand account I got to know like rehabilitation and how it hasn’t been helping so they've brought him home to not miss any last moments spent with him. And all of this breaks me, nobody should go through anything equal to this and see their loved one suffering and dying in front of them.</p>\n<p>And this made me think about what I was doing all this time when my friend or somebody close to me goes through a situation relatable to this. And the answer came out to be the one I’m not particularly happy about. Seeing someone suffering from grief my first action wants me to pull their suffering heart from the dark pit of sorrow, cheer them up, want them to smile, persevere, asking them to be happy and tell them to be strong and forget about it. And it has been like this forever. Their salvation and well being were my only purpose and makes me think I’m a good friend that is providing this type of support. But I was wrong, even the best of intentions often come up short in the face of grief. The temptation and best effort to make somebody feel better always backfire on me and this is what I’ve learned.</p>\n<h1 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ask don’t tell</h1>\n<p>People can get depressed after some mentally traumatizing or stressful life-event like losing someone. So how can you help others or a loved one who is going through the rough phase of grief and sadness? If you really want them to move on don't help them with any expectation, there mustn't be a hidden motive to help someone. </p>\n<p>It seems counterintuitive but to help someone to feel better is to let them in <em>pain</em>. You can never talk somebody out of their pain. It just makes them stop telling you about your pain. This is true to all the traumas, failure, etc, and not necessarily from the intense grieve from a deceased person’s memory. It is much more helpful to join them in their sadness but this is what we tend to do, make them look at the bright side which is what we’ve taught to be, optimistic. The truth is you can’t heal other people's pain by simply trying to take it away from them amid the darkness. Now, acknowledgement does something different, it is much more helpful to acknowledge the loss exists and live with it until it settles down on its own. Just like author <strong>Parker J. Palmer</strong> writes in his article <u>My Misgivings About Advice</u><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>:</p>\n<h6 style=\"color: rgb(252, 63, 128);\">\n<i>❝ The human soul doesn’t want to be advised or fixed or saved. It simply wants to be witnessed — to be seen, heard and companioned exactly as it is. When we make that kind of deep bow to the soul of a suffering person, our respect reinforces the soul’s healing resources, the only resources that can help the sufferer make it through. ❞</i>\n</h6>\n<p>What humans have made is not short of a wonder but all these things can’t protect someone from being not lonely with their sadness. Some people tell some don't. You can have an emotional check with the people you care about every once in a while but emotions are tricky, there are not many people who are aware of precisely what they are feelings thought the day much less the precise cause of these feeling. They still might not tell you but you have to look for cues. Understanding not your emotions but other people's emotions are a totally different thing, perhaps easy. Certain facial expressions for emotions like disgust, anger fear sadness happiness and surprise can be universally and recognize by all humans. It is you, their friend, who has to discern the meaning out of this observation. And our endeavor here is to revive that forgotten conversion about what isn’t working, and what really helps.</p>\n<p>But what happens when this sadness becomes chronic? Look for symptoms of prolonged chronic grieving that was persistent more than a year that may inhibit the person from doing daily routines and activities which according to new studies shows a substantial difference from depression as this persistent yearning tends to be more influential where that individual might find it more difficult accepting the loss. And if things get dire than this you should probably consult a person with professional mental healthcare.</p>\n<h1 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Letting things hurt</h1>\n<p>How sudden loss can suspend our world where moving on seems difficult. But it is radical to have things hurt at first. We will never get over it and crucially we don’t have to. Everything that is going wrong soon is going to be good, until you know it your tears will be washed away from the sweet release of sleep. The world may seem dark at this moment, the reach of people close to you will look far away. Nobody will understand what you're going through and it's okay. The drawback of having a powerful, imaginative brain is that we can turn anything into a source of test. The offhand comment from your boss, teacher or simply an absence of a text message from a person you’re attracted to can be interpreted by your brain as a threat to survival and this causes your body to express the physiology of stress which affects your emotional state which affects your thoughts which affects your behavior and worsen the condition.</p>\n<p>And the society won't help much, it can make you look outwards with envy and inwards with dissatisfaction. In life we travel upstream, thrashing against the mighty current of society more often than not things simply won’t pan out as you wished. Pop culture, advertising and social media makes this worse by reminding you that aiming for everything less than your dream job is failure, you need to have great experience constantly, have filthy money, be conventionally attractive, have a lot of friends and find your soulmate and that other have all of these things and are truly happy.</p>\n<p>It takes time to recover, don’t give frustration the last word. Life is a circumstance of its own, resist the temptation to renounce it. When the water calms, ask yourself if life tosses me about like a piece of driftwood, is it wiser to stay the course or find another way. Maybe this is the time you can fix your past affairs too. You just have to try, the beauty of trial and error is that there is always hope. You will again achieve your sense of meaning back, your time and energy are far better channeled elsewhere than mere stress. It's okay to talk about this to somebody when you feel like it, you made bonds with your friends and family, they will if can't help will always try to provide you with the best of their help.</p>\n<p>So when is the right time you should seek help? Think to yourself and ask if your daily chores, relationships, hobbies, work are getting affected by your mental health then it’s the red flag when you should seek help. It’s a scary process to come out with your vulnerable side to anyone, even to family, your mind can make up how you’re going to put forward those points.</p>\n<p>While you should always avoid social withdrawal there are some other factors that can complement and constructively increase your grief. You can try to eliminate rather work on these to approach a better state of being. These factors can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical Illness</li>\n<li>Sedentary Lifestyle</li>\n<li>Smoking</li>\n<li>Obesity</li>\n<li>Air Pollution</li>\n<li>Sleep Disorder</li>\n<li>Your Diet</li>\n<li>Low Self-Esteem or Socio-Economic Status</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One study found that a daily 20 min practice of slow breathing improved heart rate variability biofeedback, improves emotional and physical health, and improves the recovery process reducing craving and anxiety.</p>\n<h1 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Don't hold back the Easy Days</h1>\n<p>Present, is a precious place. Where I hope you find this article is peaceful times when everyone around you is healthy, full of vitality and consciousness within them. No noticeable illness to bother and no agonizing disease to deal with. Let's call these days as <em>Easy Days</em>. How brutally cynical and pessimistic this may sound but we can never be sure of the future to provide us with the same favourable circumstances. Dire times are inevitable and that's the beauty of <em>Easy Days</em>, we can start now, by simply accepting the relationship we have with them as they are. I'm not saying you’re going to suffer, but you’re not going to regret it.</p>\n<p>After they are gone we will always feel we didn’t always love them as we now wish we had, there were things we didn’t do with them, conversations we never had, things we wish we haven’t done, things we want to change if only we could. Regret will induce itself due to our inability to say the right things at the right moment when we had the chance and failure to do so will only inflict heartfelt emotional ache remaining of our lifetime.</p>\n<p>And there is no reason to deny that you have a hard relationship with the person when they were living, ofcourse it did. There was frustration and disappointment, fights and arguments, misunderstandings that couldn’t be put right, resentment and anxiety and tantalizing hopes that never quite fulfilled. Our relation with them is like this because this is the nature of all human relations, it is not a denial of love because love involved closeness and closeness is necessarily intricate. Ambivalence isn’t the refusal of love, it’s a consequence of the profoundest kind of love.</p>\n<p>Not everything can be made right but can be made better. And it all starts with little conversations. And we don’t even have to worry, most of what we needed to say made its way to them indirectly, we didn’t have to put them explicitly into words at a pivotal moment, they knew, guessed, they didn’t say everything either. This is how human relationship functions we don’t have to spell everything out because we do so much of the work in your mind and the proof of that we’re thinking of them now reading this article.</p>\n<p>My search to learn about this delicate bond with our loved one led me to an article by <strong>Amy Krouse Rosenthal</strong> on the modern love column, The New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html\">You May Want to Marry My Husband</a>. The piece she wrote moves me in a way I never imagined where she talks about her disease and her incoming death. A follow up video by her husband can be watched after reading that article, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lhoCdZFoktQ\">The journey through loss and grief</a>.</p>\n<h1 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">There is Light at the End</h1>\n<h6 style=\"color: rgb(252, 63, 128);display: flex;flex-direction: column;justify-content: center;align-items: center;\"><i>❝\nIt's something unpredictible<br>\nBut in the end it's right<br>\nI hope you had the time of your life\n❞</i>\n<i style=\"align-self: flex-end;color: black;\">~ Good Riddance, Green Day</i>\n</h6>\n<p>Everyone will certainly cease to exist at some point and it's okay, liberation is what our soul yearns for, that goes quite similar for our loved ones. We mustn't worry how they are now, they must be in genuine peace with the universe and anytime but not unhappy. It is frightening to die, it is not frightening to be dead, but before we do we get to explore this gift from the universe, <em>‘to exist’</em>, we get to experience feeling, love, food, literature, art, sunrises on a beach and being with each other.</p>\n<p>There are different philosophy regarding the state of human after they die, if you consider them the body, yes they will cease to exist but if you don’t consider the body it is just they can’t influence and touch the lives of other people anymore, they continue to survive with us, no one can separate us from them.</p>\n<p>Even though any word of mine can never be enough to make up for the pain <strong>SA</strong> is going through, still, the least I can do is to write this poem to all those who are there in this situation, meeting the loss of your loved ones, fathom how there is hope and it’s <strong>OK</strong> to grieve.</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex;flex-direction: column;justify-content: center;align-items:
